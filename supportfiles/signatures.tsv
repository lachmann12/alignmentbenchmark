1	CD	The C2H2 zinc finger is the most prevalent DNA-binding motif in the mammalian proteome with DNA-binding domains usually containing more tandem fingers than are needed for stable sequence-specific DNA recognition. To examine the reason for the frequent presence of multiple zinc fingers we generated mice lacking finger 1 or finger 4 of the 4-finger DNA-binding domain of Ikaros a critical regulator of lymphopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Each mutant strain exhibited a specific subset of the phenotypes observed with Ikaros null mice. Of particular relevance fingers 1 and 4 contributed to distinct stages of B- and T-cell development and finger 4 was selectively required for tumor suppression in thymocytes and in a new model of BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results combined with transcriptome profiling (this GEO submission: RNA-Seg of whole thymus from wt and the two ZnF mutants) reveal that different subsets of fingers within multi-finger transcription factors can regulate distinct target genes and biological functions and they demonstrate that selective mutagenesis can facilitate efforts to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of action of this prevalent class of factors.	gene	Thymus	GSM797705,GSM797706	GSM797707	2017-01-04 00:11:13	GSM797703	GSM797702	gene	GPL9250	GSE32190	Mus musculus	Knockout		ZnF1
2	CD	Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived skin transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to determine pathways and networks dependent on retinoic acid during skin development. Methods: Skin mRNA profiles of embryonic day E16.5 wild-type (WT) and Cyp26b1 knockout (Cyp26b1\\\\x89\\\\xf6\\\\xd5/\\\\x89\\\\xf6\\\\xd5) and of control and of dermal and epidermal skin fractions of Engrailed1cre;Cyp26b1f/- (En1cre;Cyp26b1f/-) conditional knockout mice were generated by deep sequencing in duplicate using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat. qRT\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xd2PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assay. Results: RNA-Seq data were generated with Illumina\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xaas HiSeq 2000 system. Raw sequencing data were processed with CASAVA 1.8.2 to generate fastq files. Reads of 50 bases were mapped to the mouse transcriptome and genome mm9 using TopHat 1.3.2. Gene expression values (RPKM) were calculated with Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 which was also used for the ANOVA analysis to determine significantly differentially expressed genes. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of Cyp26b1-/- skin and En1cre;Cyp26b1f/- dermis/epidermic transcriptomes with biologic replicates generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.	gene	Skin 	GSM994185,GSM994186	GSM994187,GSM994188	2017-01-04 00:11:24			gene		GSE40436	Mus musculus	Knockout		Cyp26b1-/-

4	CD	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical to proliferation differentiation and development. Here we characterize gene expression in murine Dicer-null adult mesenchymal stem cell lines a fibroblast cell type. Loss of Dicer leads to de-repression of let-7 targets at levels that exceed 10-100 fold with increases in transcription. Direct and indirect targets of this miRNA belong to a mid-gestation embryonic program that encompasses known oncofetal genes as well as oncogenes not previously associated with an embryonic state. Surprisingly this mid-gestation program represents a distinct period that occurs between the pluripotent state of the inner cell mass at embryonic day 3.5 and the induction of let-7 upon differentiation at embryonic day 10.5. Within this mid-gestation program we characterize the let-7 target Nr6a1 an embryonic transcriptional repressor that regulates gene expression in adult fibroblasts following miRNA loss. In total let-7 is required for the continual suppression of embryonic gene expression in adult cells a mechanism that may underlie its tumor suppressive function.	gene	Fibroblast	GSM1079797,GSM1079798	GSM1079799,GSM1079800	2017-01-04 00:11:35			gene	GPL13112	GSE44158	Mus musculus	Overexpression		DICER1
5	CD	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important layer of genome regulation with common mechanistic themes including the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes. Here, we present a novel X-linked lncRNA termed linc-Firre that escapes X-chromosome inactivation and forms trans-chromosomal interactions required for adipogenesis. Linc-Firre is exclusively nuclear and forms punctate expression foci on chromatin near its site of transcription on both X-chromosomes in human and mouse. Both the localization of linc-Firre and the association with the nuclear matrix protein hnRNPU require a conserved repeating RNA domain, R2D2.

7	CD	Protein Arginine MethylTransferase 5 (PRMT5) is known to mediate epigenetic control on chromatin and to functionally regulate components of the splicing machinery. In this study we show that selective deletion of PRMT5 in different organs leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At the molecular level, PRMT5 depletion results in reduced methylation of Sm proteins, aberrant constitutive splicing and in the Alternative Splicing (AS) of specific mRNAs. We identify Mdm4 as one of these mRNAs, which due to its weak 5’-Donor site, acts as a sensor of splicing defects and transduces the signal to activate the p53 response, providing a mechanistic explanation of the phenotype observed in PRMT5 conditional knockout mice. Our data demonstrate a key role of PRMT5, together with p53, as guardians of the transcriptome. This will have fundamental implications in our understanding of PRMT5 activity, both in physiological conditions, as well as pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological diseases.	gene	Neural Stem/Progenitors Cells	GSM1100740,GSM1100741,GSM1100742	GSM1100743,GSM1100744,GSM1100745	2017-01-04 00:11:52			gene	GPL13112	GSE45284	Mus musculus	knockout		Prmt5

10	CD	Background: In humans, cleft palate (CP) accounts for one of the largest number of birth defects with a complex genetic and environmental etiology. TGFβ3 has been established as an important regulator of palatal fusion in mice and it has been shown that TGFβ3-null mice exhibit CP without any other major deformities. However, the genes that regulate cellular decisions and molecular mechanisms maintained by the TGFβ3 pathway throughout palatogenesis are predominantly unexplored. Our objective in this study was to analyze global transcriptome changes within the palate during different gestational ages within TGFβ3 knockout mice to identify TGFβ3-associated genes previously unknown to be associated with the development of cleft palate. We used deep sequencing technology, RNA-Seq, to analyze the transcriptome of TGFβ3 knockout mice at crucial stages of palatogenesis, including palatal growth (E14.5), adhesion (E15.5), and fusion (E16.5). Results: The overall transcriptome analysis of TGFβ3 wildtype mice (C57BL/6) reveals that almost 6000 genes were upregulated during the transition from E14.5 to E15.5 and more than 2000 were downregulated from E15.5 to E16.5. Using bioinformatics tools and databases, we identified the most comprehensive list of CP genes (n = 322) in which mutations cause CP either in humans or mice, and analyzed their expression patterns. The expression motifs of CP genes between TGFβ3+/− and TGFβ3−/− were not significantly different from each other, and the expression of the majority of CP genes remained unchanged from E14.5 to E16.5. Using these patterns, we identified 8 unique genes within TGFβ3−/− mice (Chrng Foxc2, H19, Kcnj13, Lhx8, Meox2, Shh, and Six3), which may function as the primary contributors to the development of cleft palate in TGFβ3−/− mice. When the significantly altered CP genes were overlaid with TGFβ signaling, all of these genes followed the Smad-dependent pathway. Conclusions: Our study represents the first analysis of the palatal transcriptome of the mouse, as well as TGFβ3 knockout mice, using deep sequencing methods. In this study, we characterized the critical regulation of palatal transcripts that may play key regulatory roles through crucial stages of palatal development. We identified potential causative CP genes in a TGFβ3 knockout model, which may lead to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms of palatogenesis and provide novel potential targets for gene therapy approaches to treat cleft palate.	gene	Palatal shelves E14.5	GSM1109827,GSM1109828,GSM1109829,GSM1109830	GSM1109819,GSM1109820,GSM1109821,GSM1109822	2017-01-04 00:12:05			gene	GPL13112	GSE45568	Mus musculus	knockout		TGFB3

16	CD	Evaluation of X-linked gene expression in MEFs isolated from STC1 wild type and knock out mice X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated in cis by the Xist RNA which coats the inactive X chromosome (Xi) from which it is produced. We performed a large-scale RNA interference screen to identify trans-acting XCI factors (XCIFs) that comprise regulators of cell signaling and transcription. We find that the XCIFs promote Xist expression and/or localization to the Xi. One of the XCIFs STC1 is a glycoprotein found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and whose function is poorly understood. A homozygous mouse knockout of STC1 has a defect in XCI but surprisingly is phenotypically normal. We performed transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) experiments to determine whether the expression levels of X-encoded genes were elevated in Stc1-/- female MEFs. In these experiments RNA was prepared from three independent cultures of Stc1+/+ or Stc1-/- female MEFs. RNA samples were processed and amplified followed by deep sequencing. The similarity of X-linked gene expression between Stc1+/+ and Stc1-/- MEFs was statistically significant. The vast majority of autosomal genes were also expressed at comparable levels in Stc1+/+ and Stc1-/- MEFs.	gene	Embryonic fibroblasts	GSM1148746,GSM1148747,GSM1148748	GSM1148749,GSM1148750,GSM1148751	2017-01-04 00:12:36			gene	GPL13112	GSE47395	Mus musculus	Knockout		STC1

The tyrosine phosphatase PTPN1 targets STAT3 for dephosphorylation and leads to the deactivation of STAT3. In this study we examined the role of PTP1B in controlling the normal homeostatic level phosphorylation of STAT3 by comparing the IL-10/STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory gene expression programme. We find that loss of PTP1B leads to an up-regulation of the activity of STAT3 both at the level of phosphorylation and also in enhanced expression of anti-inflammatory gene products.	gene	Macrophages	GSM1199324,GSM1199325	GSM1199328,GSM1199329	2017-01-04 00:12:42			gene	GPL13112	GSE49449	Mus musculus	Knockout		PTP1B
19	CD	G9a/GLP and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) are two major epigenetic silencing machineries which in particular methylate histone H3 on lysines 9 and 27 (H3K9 and H3K27) respectively. Although evidence of a crosstalk between H3K9 and H3K27 methylations has started to emerge their actual interplay remains elusive. Here we show that PRC2 and G9a/GLP interact physically and functionally. Moreover combining different genome-wide approaches we demonstrate that Ezh2 and G9a/GLP share an important number of common genomic targets encoding developmental and neuronal regulators. Furthermore we show that G9a enzymatic activity modulates PRC2 genomic recruitment to a subset of its target genes. Taken together our findings demonstrate an unanticipated interplay between two main histone lysine methylation mechanisms which cooperate to maintain silencing of a subset of developmental genes.	gene	Embryonic stem cell	GSM1204719,GSM1204720,GSM1204721	GSM1204722,GSM1204723,GSM1204724	2017-01-04 00:12:46			gene	GPL13112	GSE49669	Mus musculus	Knockout		G9a

21	CD	We report the application of RNA-sequencing technology for the high-throughput profiling of mammalian lens gene expression at embryonic day 15.5. The lens has a particularly biased transcriptome with the top 50 genes encoding approximately 90% of the protein content. Using RNA-Seq we have shown that there are over 7 700 genes being expressed in the lens at embryonic day 15.5. As expected the crystallins and many structural genes were amoung the most highly expressed; however numerous genes expressed at lower transcript abundance were also identified. This study provides a framework for the application of RNA-Seq technology towards characterization of the mammalian lens transcriptome during development. Using high-throughput RNA-sequencing gene expression in the mammalian lens was compared between an inbred C56Bl/6&lt;har&gt; strain and a mix background strain at E15.5. This analysis identifies almost 2 000 genes being differentially expressed between the inbred and mixed background lenses ranging from 6.5 fold upregulated to 5.2 fold downregulated in the mixed background compared to the inbred strain. This list does not include unknown/predicted genes or pseudogenes which are known to change between strains. Further it appears that approximately 98% of these genes are altered at levels less than 2.5 fold. This study therefore provides a fold change threshold cutoff (2.5 fold) to use in the analysis of differentially expressed lens genes at E15.5 using RNA-Seq technology as it takes into account genetic variation due to background strain differences. SIP1 encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates multiple developmental processes as highlighted by the pleiotropic defects observed in Mowat-Wilson Syndrome which results from mutations in this gene. Further in adults dysregulated SIP1 expression has been implicated in both cancer and fibrotic diseases where it functionally links TGFb signaling to the loss of epithelial preferred gene expression. In the ocular lens an epithelial tissue important for vision Sip1 is co-expressed with epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and is required for the complete separation of the lens vesicle from the head ectoderm during early ocular morphogenesis. However the function of Sip1 after early lens morphogenesis is still unknown. Here we conditionally deleted Sip1 from the developing mouse lens shortly after lens vesicle closure leading to defects in coordinated fiber cell tip migration defective suture formation and cataract. Interestingly RNA-Sequencing analysis on Sip1 knockout lenses identified 190 differentially expressed genes all of which are distinct from previously described Sip1 target genes involved in EMT/cancer. Furthermore 34% of the upregulated genes in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally downregulated as the lens transitions from the lens vesicle to early lens while 49% of the genes downregulated in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally upregulated during early lens development. Overall these data imply that Sip1 plays a major role in reprogramming the lens vesicle away from a surface ectoderm cell fate towards that necessary for the development of a transparent lens and demonstrate that Sip1 regulates distinctly different sets of genes in different cellular contexts.	gene	Lens	GSM1210570,GSM1210571,GSM1210572	GSM1210573,GSM1210574,GSM1210575	2017-01-04 00:12:57			gene	GPL13112	GSE49949	Mus musculus	Knockout		Sip1

24	CD	Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived femoral diaphysis and metaphysis transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to determine pathways and networks dependent on Dlx3 during bone development and homeostasis. Methods: mRNA profiles of diaphysis and metaphysis isolated from the femur of 5-week-old wild-type (WT) and Dlx3Oc-cKO (OC-cre;Dlx3f/-) conditional knockout mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assay. Results: RNA-Seq data were generated with Illumina's HiSeq 2000 system. Raw sequencing data were processed with CASAVA 1.8.2 to generate fastq files. Reads of 50 bases were mapped to the mouse transcriptome and genome mm9 using TopHat 1.3.2. Gene expression values (RPKM) were calculated with Partek Genomics Suite 6.6, which was also used for the ANOVA analysis to determine significantly differentially expressed genes. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of Dlx3Oc-cKO diaphysis and metaphysis from femurs, with biologic triplicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles.

26	CD	 The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is critical for myogenesis and can induce muscle progenitors to switch from proliferation to differentiation; how Wnt signals integrate with muscle specific regulatory factors in this process is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that the Barx2 homeobox protein promotes differentiation in cooperation with the muscle regulatory factor (MRF) MyoD. Pax7, another important muscle homeobox factor represses differentiation. We now identify Barx2,MyoD,and Pax7 as novel components of the Wnt effector complex, providing a new molecular pathway for regulation of muscle progenitor differentiation. Canonical Wnt signaling induces Barx2 expression in muscle progenitors and perturbation of Barx2 leads to misregulation of Wnt target genes. Barx2 activates two endogenous Wnt target promoters as well as the Wnt reporter gene TOPflash, the latter synergistically with MyoD. Moreover, Barx2 interacts with the core Wnt effectors β-catenin and TCF, is recruited to TCF/LEF sites, and promotes recruitment of β-catenin. In contrast, Pax7 represses the Wnt reporter gene and antagonizes the activating effect of Barx2. Pax7 also binds β-catenin suggesting that Barx2 and Pax7 may compete for interaction with the core Wnt effector complex. Overall, the data show for the first time that Barx2, Pax7, and MRFs can act as direct transcriptional effectors of Wnt signals in myoblasts and that Barx2 and Wnt signaling participate in a regulatory loop. We propose that antagonism between Barx2 and Pax7 in regulation of Wnt signaling may help mediate the switch from myoblast proliferation to differentiation	gene	Skeletal muscle (primary myoblasts)	GSM1290885,GSM1290886	GSM1290887,GSM1290888	2017-01-04 00:13:19			gene	GPL13112	GSE53398	Mus musculus	knockout		Barx2

28	CD	The overall goal of our studies is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanism by which the transcription factor Casz1 functions in murine heart development. We established that Casz1 is expressed in myocardial progenitor cells beginning at E7.5 and in differentiated cardiomyocytes throughout development. We generated conditional Casz1 knockout mice to show that ablation of CASZ1 in Nkx2.5-positive cardiomyocytes leads to cardiac hypoplasia ventricular septal defects and lethality by E13.5. To identify the pathways and networks by which Casz1 regulates cardiomyocyte development we used RNA-Seq and identified genes involved in cell proliferation are upregulated in Casz1 mutants compared to wild-type littermates. We conclude that Casz1 is essential for cardiac development and has a pivotal role in regulating part of the cardiac transcriptional program.	gene	Heart	GSM1335300,GSM1335304,GSM1335305	GSM1335301,GSM1335302,GSM1335303	2017-01-04 00:13:28			gene	GPL17021	GSE55394	Mus musculus	Knockout		Casz1
29	CD	Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a photoreceptor disease that affects approximately 100 000 people in the United States.

30	CD	Tight regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis is essential for life-long hematopoiesis for preventing blood cancers and for averting bone marrow failure. The underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we identify production of inositol-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) by inositoltrisphosphate 3-kinase B (ItpkB) as essential for HSC quiescence and function. Young ItpkB-/- mice accumulated phenotypic HSC and showed extramedullary hematopoiesis. ItpkB-/- HSC were less quiescent and proliferated more than wildtype controls. They downregulated quiescence and stemness associated mRNAs but upregulated activation oxidative metabolism protein synthesis and lineage associated transcripts. Although they showed no significant homing defects ItpkB-/- HSC had a severely reduced competitive long-term repopulating potential. Aging ItpkB-/- mice lost hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and died with severe anemia. Wildtype HSC normally repopulated ItpkB-/- hosts incidating a HSC-intrinsic ItpkB requirement. ItpkB-/- HSC had reduced cobblestone-area forming cell activity in vitro and showed increased stem-cell-factor activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) effector Akt reversed by exogenous provision of the known PI3K/Akt antagonist IP4. They also showed transcriptome changes consistent with hyperactive Akt/mTOR signaling. Thus we propose that ItpkB ensures HSC quiescence by limiting cytokine-induced PI3K signaling in HSC.	gene	Hematopoietic stem cell	GSM1365846,GSM1365847,GSM1365848	GSM1365844,GSM1365845	2017-01-04 00:13:38			gene	GPL13112	GSE56613	Mus musculus	Knockout		IPTKB

The development and function of Tregs are dependent on transcriptional factor Foxp3, but how constant expression of Foxp3 is maintained in Tregs is not clear. Here we show that ablation of the conserved non-coding DNA sequence 2 (CNS2) at the Foxp3 locus in mice led to spontaneous lymphoproliferative disease and exacerbation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). CNS2 is required for activated Treg cells to maintain elevated Foxp3 expression, which is critical for their suppressor function and lineage stability. Mechanistically, upon TCR stimulation, NFAT binds to both CNS2 and Foxp3 promoter and mediates the interaction between CNS2 and Foxp3 promoter.

36	CD	Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are required for normal differentiation and development, and their activity is found deregulated in cancer. PcG proteins are involved in gene silencing, however, whether they initiate or maintain transcriptional repression is a subject of debate. Here, we show that knockout of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) does not lead to significant gene expression changes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and that it is dispensable for initiating silencing of target genes during differentiation. Transcriptional inhibition in mESCs is sufficient to induce genome-wide ectopic PRC2 recruitment to endogenous PcG target genes found in other tissues. PRC2 binding analysis shows that it is restricted to nucleosome-free CpG islands (CGIs) of un-transcribed genes. Our results show that it is the transcriptional state that governs PRC2 binding, and we propose that it binds by default to non-transcribed CGI genes to maintain their silenced state and to protect cell identity.	gene	Embryonic Stem Cells	GSM1399452,GSM1399453,GSM1399454	GSM1399449,GSM1399450,GSM1399451	2017-01-04 00:14:02			gene	GPL13112	GSE58016	Mus musculus	knockout		Ezh2
37	CD	Purpose: Epigenetic regulation contributes to pathogenesis of neurondegenerative disease. We found that dis-regulation of a 242-gene subnetwork related to DNA methylation regulated neuronal differentiation are common in AD and HD. There are two DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3A, in the subnetwork. DNMT1 is one of top hub genes in the network and likely to play a key regulatory role in the subnetwork. To validate that DNMT1 is a key regulator for the subnetwork, and DNMT3A not as one, we constructed two brain-specific conditional knockout mice. Methods: Cortices were dissected from Dnmt1 conditional knockout (CKO), Dnmt3a CKO, and respective littermate control mice at 18 weeks. RNA was isolated from three biological replicates for each genotype using TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction and isopropanol precipitation. RNA samples were resuspended in water and further purified with RNeasy columns with on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen). RNA purity was assessed by measuring the A260/A280 ratio using a NanoDrop and RNA quality checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Approximately 250 ng of total RNA per sample were used for library construction by the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence reads were aligned to mouse genome assembly mm10 and quantified using Cufflinks. Results: Genes differentially expressed in CKO mice compared to littermate control mice, or the Dnmt1 CKO signature, including GSN (the genes with the largest number of connection in the subnetwork) and SOX10 (a key transcription factor of myelination), significantly overlaps with the subnetwork. Broadly, the Dnmt1 CKO signature is enriched for genes involved in GO biological processes immune response, lipid metabolism, endocytosis, glial cell differentiation, and nerve ensheatment, consistent with biological function of the subnetwork. Moreover, the Dnmt1 CKO mice show increased predilection to seizures, an incidence also increased in patients with AD (Amatniek et al, 2006) as well as juvenile form of HD (Cloud et al, 2012). In contrast, the Dnmt3a CKO signature does not overlap with the subnetwork (p=0.07) and is not enriched for any GO biological process. Conclusions: These results suggest the Dnmt1 regulates common genes related with AD and HD while Dnmt3a has little effect.	gene	Cortex	GSM1405323,GSM1405324,GSM1405325	GSM1405326,GSM1405327,GSM1405328	2017-01-04 00:14:06			gene	GPL17021	GSE58261	Mus musculus	knockout		Dnmt1

46	CD	Purpose: RNA editing by ADAR1 is essential for hematopoietic development. The goals of this study were firstly to identify ADAR1-specific RNA-editing sites by indentifying A-to-I (G) mismatches in RNA-seq data compared to mm9 reference genome in wild type mice that were not edited or reduced in editing frequency in ADAR1E861A editing deficient mice. Secondly to determine the transcriptional consequence of an absence of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing. Methods: Fetal liver mRNA profiles of embryonic day 12.5 wild-type (WT) and ADAR1 editing-deficient (ADAR1E861A) mice were generated by RNA sequencing in triplicate (biological replicates) using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xd2PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. A-to-I (G) RNA editing sites were identified as previously described by Ramaswami G. et al. Nature Methods 2012 using Burrows\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xd2Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA). RNA editing sites were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 14 484 transcripts in the fetal livers of WT and ADAR1E861A mice with BWA. RNA-seq data had a goodness of fit (R2) of &gt;0.94 between biological triplicates per genotype. Approximately 4.4% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and ADAR1E861A fetal liver with a LogFC\\\\x89\\\\xe4\\\\xb41.5 and p value &lt;0.05. A profound upregulation of interferon stimulated genes were found to be massively upregulated (up to 11 logFC) in ADAR1E861A fetal liver compared to WT. 6 012 A-to-I RNA editing sites were identified when assessing mismatches in RNA-seq data of WT and ADAR1E861A fetal liver. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of fetal liver transcriptomes and A-to-I RNA editing sites with biologic replicates generated by RNA-seq technology. A-to-I RNA editing is the essential function of ADAR1 and is required to suppress interferon signaling to endogenous RNA.	gene	Fetal Liver	GSM1422274,GSM1422270,GSM1422272	GSM1422275,GSM1422271,GSM1422273	2017-01-04 00:14:40			gene	GPL13112	GSE58917	Mus musculus	Mutant		ADAR E861A

48	CD	Down syndrome (DS) results from trisomy of chromosome 21 (HSA21). Some DS phenotypes may be directly or indirectly related to the increased expression of specific HSA21 genes in particular those encoding transcription factors. The HSA21 encoded Single-minded 2 (SIM2) transcription factor has key neurological functions and is a good candidate to be involved in the cognitive impairment of DS. ChIP-sequencing was used to map SIM2 binding in mouse embryonic stem cells and has revealed 1229 high-confidence SIM2-binding sites. Analysis of the SIM2 target genes confirmed the importance of SIM2 in developmental and neuronal processes and indicated that SIM2 may be a master transcription regulator. Indeed SIM2 DNA binding sites share sequence specificity and overlapping domains of occupancy with master transcription factors such as SOX2 OCT4 NANOG or KLF4. The association between SIM2 and these pioneer factors is supported by the finding that SIM2 can be co-immunoprecipitated with SOX2 OCT4 NANOG or KLF4. Furthermore the binding of SIM2 marks a particular sub-category of enhancers known as super-enhancers. These regions are characterized by typical DNA modifications and Mediator co-occupancy (MED1 and MED12). Altogether we provide evidence that SIM2 binds a specific set of enhancer elements thus explaining how SIM2 can regulate its gene network in DS neuronal features.	gene	Embryonic stem cells	GSM1436017,GSM1436018,GSM1436019	GSM1436014,GSM1436015,GSM1436016	2017-01-04 00:14:47			gene	GPL13112	GSE59373	Mus musculus	Expression		Sim2

51	CD	Huntington neurodegenerative disease (HD) is associated with extensive down-regulation of neuronal genes. We show preferential down-regulation of super-enhancer-regulated neuronal function genes in the striatum of HD mice. Striatal super-enhancers display extensive H3K27 acetylation within gene bodies and drive transcription characterized by low levels of paused RNAPII. Down-regulation of gene expression is associated with diminished H3K27 acetylation and RNAPII recruitment. Striatal super-enhancers are enriched in binding motifs for Gata transcription factors such as Gata2 regulating striatal identity genes. Thus enhancer topography and transcription dynamics are major parameters determining the propensity of a gene to be deregulated in a neurodegenerative disease.	gene	Striatum	GSM1439579,GSM1439580,GSM1439581	GSM1439582,GSM1439583	2017-01-04 00:15:08			gene	GPL13112	GSE59571	Mus musculus	Mutant		HD (R6/1; transgenic for exon 1)
52	CD	Methods: CaMKIIa-creERT2 (Erdmann et al. 2007) and Dicer1f/f (Harfe et al. 2005) were crossed to produce inducible forebrain-restricted Dicer1 knockout mice (Dicer-ifKO) mice. Hippocampal mRNA profiles of 3-month-old wild-type (WT) and (Dicer-ifKO) mice were generated by deep sequencing in triplicate using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Each sample included total RNA isolated from the hippocampus of 3 mice. In total 12 mice per genotype were used. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to reference genome (GRCm38/mm10) using Bowtie 2 (2.0.5) and TopHat (2.0.6). SAM/BAM files were further processed with Samtools (0.1.18). Read count quantitations were obtained using Seqmonk (0.26.0). Normalization of read counts and differential expression analysis between genotypes was carried out using DESeq2 R package from Bioconductor (Release 2.13). qRT\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xd2PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: We mapped about 13-14 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build GRCm38/mm10) and quantified 76 938 annotated transcripts. DESeq2 R package was used to normalize the counts and perform the differential expression. Differential analysis output was filtered by FDR threshold (padj &lt; 0.1). This approach led us to identify 641 gene isoforms corresponding to 314 genes that were differentially regulated in the mouse hippocampus upon Dicer ablation. Conclusions: We extend here the characterization of inducible forebrain-restricted Dicer1 mutants confirming the initial memory improvement. Moreover we describe several novel phenotypes associated with early Dicer loss in the mature brain including an exacerbated response to seizures increased CA1 neuron excitability a pronounced weight gain and enhanced induction of immediate early genes (IEGs) in relevant neuronal nuclei. To identify candidate genes that could explain these phenotypes we conducted two complementary genomic screens for the miRNAs primarily affected and their targets. Overall our results explain both the initial and late consequences of Dicer loss in excitatory neurons and indicate that Dicer and the miRNA system play a critical role regulating neuronal homeostasis and responsiveness.	gene	Hippocampus	GSM1468805,GSM1468806,GSM1468807	GSM1468808,GSM1468809,GSM1468810	2017-01-04 00:15:12			gene	GPL17021	GSE60261	Mus musculus	Knockout		DICER1
53	CD	Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, is highly heterogeneous with distinct molecular subtypes and cellular origins. Although current treatments improve survival rates, patients suffer severe treatment-related side effects and often relapse of tumors carrying resistance mutations, underscoring an urgent need for alternative targeted therapies. Currently, the genetic alterations underlying this disease are not fully understood. Here we identify GNAS, encoding the G-protein Gs-alpha, as a potent tumor suppressor gene in medulloblastoma. GNAS specifically defines a subset of aggressive Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-group medulloblastomas. Gnas loss-of-function in distinct lineage progenitors of the developing hindbrain suffices to initiate medulloblastoma. We find that Gs-alpha is highly enriched at primary cilia of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling not only by regulating classic cAMP-dependent pathway but also controlling ciliary trafficking of Smoothened. Concurrent cAMP elevation and Smoothened inhibition robustly arrests tumor cell growth in Gnas mutants. We further reveal oligodendrocyte progenitors as a novel cellular origin for anatomically-distinct Shh-associated medulloblastomas. Together, we identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of Gs-alpha in medulloblastoma partially mediated through inhibiting Shh signaling, and uncover Gs-alpha as a molecular link across disparate cells of origin among Shh-group medulloblastomas, pointing to G- protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue.

Recent studies have suggested that Tet3-mediated oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and DNA replication-dependent dilution both contribute to global paternal DNA demethylation but demethylation of the maternal genome occurs via replication. Here we present genome-scale DNA methylation maps for both the paternal and maternal genomes of Tet3-depleted and/or DNA replication-inhibited zygotes. In both genomes we found that inhibition of DNA replication blocks DNA demethylation independently from Tet3 function and that Tet3 facilitates DNA demethylation by coupling with DNA replication. For both our data indicate that replication-dependent dilution is the major contributor to demethylation but Tet3 plays an important role particularly at certain loci.

60	CD	Organismal development requires the precise coordination of genetic programs to regulate cell fate and function. MEF2 transcription factors play essential roles in this process but how these broadly expressed factors contribute to the generation of specific cell types during development is poorly understood. Here we show that despite being expressed in virtually all mammalian tissues in the retina MEF2D binds to retina-specific enhancers and controls photoreceptor cell development. MEF2D achieves specificity by cooperating with a retina-specific factor CRX which recruits MEF2D away from canonical MEF2 binding sites and redirects it to retina-specific enhancers that lack the consensus MEF2 sequence. Once bound to retina-specific enhancers MEF2D and CRX co-activate the expression of photoreceptor-specific genes that are critical for retinal function. These findings demonstrate that broadly expressed TFs acquire specific functions through competitive recruitment to enhancers by tissue-specific TFs and through cooperative activation of these enhancers to regulate tissue-specific genes.	gene	Retina	GSM1503669,GSM1503670,GSM1503673,GSM1503674	GSM1503671,GSM1503672	2017-01-04 00:15:51			gene	GPL13112	GSE61389	Mus musculus	Knockout		Mef2d

65	CD	The transcriptional activator MyoD serves as a master controller of myogenesis. Often in partnership with Mef2 MyoD binds to the promoters of hundreds of muscle genes in proliferating myoblasts yet activates these targets only upon receiving cues that launch differentiation. What regulates this off/on switch of MyoD function has been incompletely understood although known to reflect the action of chromatin modifiers. Here we identify KAP1/TRIM28 as a key regulator of MyoD function. In myoblasts KAP1 is present with MyoD and Mef2 at many muscle genes where it acts as a scaffold to recruit not only co-activators such as p300 and LSD1 but also co-repressors such as G9a and HDAC1 with promoter silencing as net outcome. Upon differentiation MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of KAP1 releases the co-repressors from the scaffold unleashing transcriptional activation by MyoD/Mef2 and their positive cofactors. Thus our results reveal KAP1 as a previously unappreciated interpreter of cell signaling which modulates the ability of MyoD to drive myogenesis.	gene	Skeletal muscle	GSM1531002,GSM1531003	GSM1531005,GSM1531006	2017-01-04 00:16:10			gene	GPL13112	GSE62659	Mus musculus	Knockdown		Kap1

Lamins form the major structural component of the lamina and have been reported to bind DNA and chromatin. Here we systematically evaluated whether lamins are necessary for the peripheral localization of LADs in murine embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly removal of essentially all lamins did not have any detectable effect on the genome-wide interaction pattern of chromatin with the inner nuclear membrane.

75	CD	Aging and increased amyloid burden are major risk factors for cognitive diseases such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). An effective therapy does not yet exist. Here we use mouse models for age-associated memory impairment and amyloid deposition to study transcriptome and cell type-specific epigenome plasticity at the systems level in the brain and in peripheral organs. We show that at the level of epigenetic gene-expression aging and amyloid pathology are associated with inflammation and impaired synaptic function in the hippocampal CA1 region. While inflammation is associated with increased gene-expression that is linked to a subset of transcription factors de-regulation of plasticity genes is mediated via different mechanisms in the amyloid and the aging model. Amyloid pathology impairs histone-acetylation and decreases expression of plasticity genes while aging affects differential splicing that is linked to altered H4K12 acetylation at the intron-exon junction in neurons but not in non-neuronal cells. We furthermore show that oral administration of the clinically approved histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat not only restores spatial memory but also exhibits an anti-inflammatory action and reinstates epigenetic balance and transcriptional homeostasis at the level of gene expression and exon usage. This is the first systems-level investigation of transcriptome plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region in aging and AD models and of the effects of an orally dosed histone deacetylase inhibitor. Our data has important implications for the development of minimally invasive and cost-effective therapeutic strategies against age-associated cognitive decline. In fact our data strongly suggest to test Vorinostat in patients suffering from AD.)	gene	Hippocampus (CA1 subregion)	GSM1561032,GSM1561033,GSM1561034,GSM1561035,GSM1561036,GSM1561037,GSM1561038,GSM1561039,GSM1561040,GSM1561041,GSM1561042	GSM1561043,GSM1561044,GSM1561045,GSM1561046,GSM1561047,GSM1561048,GSM1561049,GSM1561050,GSM1561051	2017-01-04 00:17:00			gene	GPL13112	GSE63943	Mus musculus	Transgenic		APP/PS1-21

79	CD	PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine the gene expression networks regulated by tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2, or Tnfrsf1b) and to evaluate their potential bearing on immune cell subsets and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: mRNA-seq was performed on isolated distal colons from TNFR2-knockout and wildtype mice. Differentially expressed transcripts were compared to human ulcerative colitis microarray datasets on Gene Expression Omnibus and to mouse immunological expression datasets at the Immunological Genome Project. RESULTS: We identified 252 mouse transcripts whose expressions were significantly altered by the loss of TNFR2. The majority of these transcripts (228 of 252, ~90%) were downregulated in TNFR2-/- colons. TNFR2-regulated genes were able to positively discriminate between ulcerative colitis patients and healthy individuals with ~80% accuracy. Many TNFR2-regulated genes were also highly expressed in CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Downregulation of TNFR2 is associated with a gene expression profile that is prominent in IBD and supportive of the role of CD8+ T cells in IBD pathogenesis.	gene	Colon (distal colon)	GSM1595696,GSM1595697,GSM1595698	GSM1595699,GSM1595700,GSM1595701	2017-01-04 00:17:17			gene	GPL13112	GSE65408	Mus musculus	knockout		TNFR2

85	CD	The ZFP36L3 protein is a rodent-specific, placenta- and yolk sac-specific member of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins. These proteins bind to AU-rich elements in target mRNAs, and promote their deadenylation and decay. Mice deficient in ZFP36L3 exhibited decreased neonatal survival rates, but no apparent morphological changes in the placenta or surviving offspring. Zfp36l3 is paternally imprinted, with profound parent-of-origin effects on gene expression. RNASeq of KO placental mRNA revealed many significantly affected transcripts, some of which exhibited decreased decay rates in differentiated trophoblast stem cells derived from KO blastocysts. The type 1 transferrin receptor mRNA was unexpectedly decreased in KO placentas, despite an increase in its stability. This receptor is critical for placental iron uptake from the maternal circulation, and its decrease was accompanied by decreased iron stores in the KO fetus, suggesting that this intrauterine deficiency might have deleterious consequences in later life.	gene	Yolk sac 	GSM1615062,GSM1615063,GSM1615064,GSM1615065	GSM1615066,GSM1615067,GSM1615068,GSM1615069	2017-01-04 00:17:42			gene	GPL13112	GSE66138	Mus musculus	knockout		ZFP36L3
86	CD	Most mammalian transcription factors and cofactors occupy thousands of genomic sites and modulate the expression of large gene networks to implement their biological functions. In this study we describe an exception to this paradigm. TRIM33 is identified here as a lineage dependency in B cell neoplasms and is shown to perform this essential function by associating with a single cis element. ChIP-seq analysis of TRIM33 in murine B cell leukemia revealed a preferential association with two lineage-specific enhancers that harbor an exceptional density of motifs recognized by the PU.1 transcription factor. TRIM33 is recruited to these elements by PU.1 yet acts to antagonize PU.1 function. One of the PU.1/TRIM33 co-occupied enhancers is upstream of the pro-apoptotic gene Bim and deleting this enhancer renders TRIM33 dispensable for leukemia cell survival. These findings reveal an essential role for TRIM33 in preventing apoptosis in B lymphoblastic leukemia by interfering with enhancer-mediated Bim activation.	gene	B lymphoblastic leukemia cells	GSM1617779,GSM1617781	GSM1617778,GSM1617780	2017-01-04 00:17:45			gene	GPL13112	GSE66232	Mus musculus	Knockdown		Trim33
87	CD	Super-enhancers (SEs) are large clusters of transcriptional enhancers that are co-occupied by multiple lineage specific transcription factors driving expression of genes that define cell identity. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs) SEs are highly enriched for Oct4 Sox2 and Nanog in the enhanceosome assembly and express enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). We sought to dissect the molecular control mechanism of SE activity and eRNA transcription for pluripotency and reprogramming. Starting from a protein interaction network surrounding Sox2 a key pluripotency and reprogramming factor that guides the ESC-specific enhanceosome assembly and orchestrates the hierarchical transcriptional activation during the final stage of reprogramming we discovered Tex10 as a novel pluripotency factor that is evolutionally conserved and functionally significant in ESC self-renewal early embryo development and reprogramming. Tex10 is enriched at SEs in a Sox2-dependent manner and coordinates histone acetylation and DNA demethylation of SEs. Our study sheds new light on epigenetic control of SE activity for cell fate determination.	gene	Embryonic Stem cells	GSM1631189	GSM1631190,GSM1631191	2017-01-04 00:17:48		GSM1631188	gene	GPL17021	GSE66734	Mus musculus	Knockdown		Tex10

90	CD	Disruption of the MECP2 gene leads to Rett syndrome (RTT) a severe neurological disorder with features of autism. MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein that is proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor but despite numerous studies examining neuronal gene expression in MeCP2 mutants no coherent model has emerged for how MeCP2 regulates transcription. Here we identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in the expression of long genes in neurons lacking MeCP2. This gene misregulation occurs in human RTT brains and correlates with onset and severity of phenotypes in Mecp2 mutant mice suggesting that the disruption of long gene expression contributes to RTT pathology. We present evidence that MeCP2 represses long genes by binding to brain-enriched methylated CA dinucleotides within genes and show that loss of methylated CA in the brain recapitulates gene expression defects observed in MeCP2 mutants. We find that long genes encode proteins with neuronal functions and overlap substantially with genes that have been implicated in autism and Fragile X syndrome. Reversing the overexpression of long genes in neurons lacking MeCP2 can improve some RTT-associated cellular deficits. These findings suggest that a function of MeCP2 in the mammalian brain is to temper the expression of genes in a length-dependent manner and that mutations in MeCP2 and possibly other autism genes may cause neurological dysfunction by disrupting the expression of long genes in the brain.	gene	Visual Cortex	GSM1643943,GSM1643944,GSM1643945	GSM1643940,GSM1643941,GSM1643942	2017-01-04 00:18:02			gene	GPL13112	GSE67294	Mus musculus	Knockout		MeCP2
91	CD	Embryonic stem cells are maintained in a self-renewing and pluripotent state by multiple regulatory pathways. Pluripotent-specific transcriptional networks are sequentially reactivated as somatic cells reprogram to achieve pluripotency. How epigenetic regulators modulate this process and contribute to somatic cell reprogramming is not clear. Here we perform a functional RNAi screen to identify the earliest epigenetic regulators required for reprogramming. We identify components of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex in particular Gcn5 as critical regulators of reprogramming initiation. Furthermore we show in mouse pluripotent stem cells that Gcn5 strongly associates with Myc and that upon initiation of somatic reprogramming Gcn5 and Myc form a positive feed forward loop that activates a distinct alternative splicing network and the early acquisition of pluripotency-associated splicing events. These studies expose a Myc-SAGA pathway that drives expression of an essential alternative splicing regulatory network during somatic cell reprogramming.	gene	Embryonic Stem cells	GSM1654362,GSM1654364	GSM1654363,GSM1654365	2017-01-04 00:18:05			gene	GPL13112	GSE67691	Mus musculus	Knockout		Gcn5
92	CD	The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor (free fatty acid receptor-3; FFAR3) is expressed in pancreatic beta cells; however, its role in insulin secretion is not clearly defined. Here, we examined the role of FFAR3 in insulin secretion. Using islets from global knockout FFAR3 (Ffar3-/-) mice, we explored the role of FFAR3 and ligand-induced FFAR3 signaling on glucose stimulated insulin secretion. RNA sequencing was also performed to gain greater insight into the impact of FFAR3 deletion on the islet transcriptome. First exploring insulin secretion, it was determined that Ffar3-/- islets secrete more insulin in a glucose-dependent manner as compared to wildtype (WT) islets. Next, exploring its primary endogenous ligand, propionate, and a specific agonist for FFAR3, signaling by FFAR3 inhibited glucose-dependent insulin secretion, which occurred through a Gαi/o pathway. To help understand these results, transcriptome analyses by RNA-sequencing of Ffar3-/- and WT islets observed multiple genes with well known roles in islet biology to be altered by genetic knockout of FFAR3. Our data shows that FFAR3 signaling mediates glucose stimulated insulin secretion through Gαi/o sensitive pathway. Future studies are needed to more rigorously define the role of FFAR3 by in vivo approaches.	gene	Pancreatic islets	GSM1660657,GSM1660658,GSM1660659	GSM1660660,GSM1660662	2017-01-04 00:18:10	GSM1660661		gene	GPL13112	GSE67991	Mus musculus	knockout		FFAR3

Sequencing results showed that approximately 640 genes were downregulated 2 fold or more in the testes of mutant mice.

96	CD	Mammalian circadian rhythm is established by the negative feedback loops consisting of a set of clock genes which lead to the circadian expression of thousands of downstream genes. As genome-wide transcription is organized under the high-order chromosome structure it is unclear how circadian gene expression is influenced by chromosome structure. In this study we focus on the function of chromatin structure proteins cohesin as well as CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) in circadian rhythm. We analyzed the interactome of a Bmal1-bound enhancer upstream of a clock gene Nr1d1 by 4C-seq and observed that cohesin binding sites are enriched in the interactome. Integrating circadian transcriptome data and cistrome data we found that cohesin-CTCF co-binding sites tend to insulate the phases of circadian oscillating genes while cohesin-non-CTCF sites facilitate the interaction between circadian enhancer and promoter. A coarse-grained model integrating the long-range effect of cohesin and CTCF markedly improved our mechanistic understanding of circadian gene expression. This model is subsequently supported by our RNA-seq data from cohesin knockout cells. Cohesin is required at least in part for driving the circadian gene expression by facilitating the enhancer-promoter looping. Taken together our study provided a novel insight into the relationship between circadian transcriptome and the high-order chromosome structure.	gene	Embryonic fibroblast	GSM1682610,GSM1682611	GSM1682612,GSM1682613	2017-01-04 00:18:35			gene	GPL13112	GSE68831	Mus musculus	Knockout		Smc3

98	CD	Consumption of a protein containing meal by a fasted animal promotes protein accretion in skeletal muscle, in part through leucine stimulation of protein synthesis and indirectly through repression of protein degradation mediated by its metabolite, α-ketoisocaproate. Mice lacking the mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm/Bcat2), that interconverts leucine and α-ketoisocaproate, exhibit elevated protein turnover. Here, the transcriptomes of gastrocnemius muscle from BCATm knockout (KO) and wildtype mice were compared using Next Generation RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify potential adaptations associated with their persistently altered nutrient signaling. Statistically significant changes in the abundance of 1486/~39,010 genes were identified. Bioinformatics analysis of the RNA-Seq data indicated that pathways involved in protein synthesis (eIF2, mTOR, eIF4 and p70S6K pathways including 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins), protein breakdown (e.g., ubiquitin mediated), and muscle degeneration (apoptosis, atrophy, myopathy and cell death) were up-regulated. Also in agreement with our previous observations, the abundance of mRNAs associated with reduced body size, glycemia, plasma insulin, and lipid signaling pathways were observed in BCATm KO mice. Consistently, genes encoding anaerobic and/or oxidative metabolism of carbohydrate, fatty acids and BCAAs were modestly but systematically reduced. Although there was no indication that muscle fiber type was different between KO and wildtype mice, a difference in the abundance of mRNAs associated with a muscular dystrophy phenotype was observed, consistent with the published exercise intolerance of these mice. The results suggest transcriptional adaptations occur in BCATm KO mice that along with altered nutrient signaling may contribute to their previously reported protein turnover, metabolic and exercise phenotypes.	gene	Gastrocnemius skeletal muscle	GSM1686397,GSM1686398,GSM1686399,GSM1686400	GSM1686401,GSM1686402,GSM1686403,GSM1686404	2017-01-04 00:18:45			gene	GPL17021	GSE68915	Mus musculus	Knockout		BCAT2

The mammalian lens is notable for its biased gene expression, where 90% of the observed protein is expressed by just 50 genes. RNAseq was employed to sequence past these highly expressed lens structural genes and report the relative abundance of both high and low expression genes. In this study we demonstrated that 642 genes were differentially expressed in the lenses of Prox1 cKOs as compared to WT lenses. These data were analyzed using the DAVID biostatical analysis package and we found that the expression of lens specific proteins, as well as cytoskeletal genes and genes that regulated the cytoskeleton were expressed at lower levels in Prox1 cKOs. This analysis showed that the expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix components and their regulators, as well as cell adhesion increased in Prox1 cKO lenses when compared to WTs. Description of Filtering Criteria: Our initial analysis identified 5,492 genes that were differentially expressed in Prox1 cKO lenses as compared to WTs as computed by Pair-wise qCML method exact tests with a Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate correction greater than the threshold of P < 0.05. As we described previously, there is significant variation in gene expression between inbred C57Bl/6 <har> and mice with a mixed background below a threshold of 2.5 fold. For this reason we filtered out all genes whose differential expression was less than 2.5 fold. We also wanted to filter out genes that were expressed at such low levels that they were unlikely to impact cellular function. We restricted our list to those genes that were expressed at greater than 2 Reads per Kilobase per million reads (RPKM) in either WT or Prox1 cKO samples, a value which corresponds to approximately 1 mRNA molecule per cell. The application of these filtering criteria resulted in narrowing our list to 642 genes that were likely to impact the Prox1 cKO lens phenotype. Manthey, A. L., Lachke, S. A., FitzGerald, P.

100	CD	The KDM6 histone demethylases (UTX/KDM6A and JMJD3/KDM6B) mediate removal of repressive histone H3K27me3 marks to establish transcriptionally permissive chromatin. Loss of UTX in female mice is embryonic lethal. Unexpectedly male UTX-null mice escape embryonic lethality due to expression of UTY a paralog lacking H3K27-demethylase activity. This suggests that UTX plays an enzyme-independent role in development and challenges the need for active H3K27-demethylation in vivo. However the requirement for active H3K27-demethylation in stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration remains untested. Using an inducible mouse knockout that ablates UTX in satellite cells we show that active H3K27-demethylation is necessary for muscle regeneration. Indeed loss of UTX in satellite cells blocks myofiber regeneration in both male and female mice. Furthermore we demonstrate that UTX mediates muscle regeneration through its H3K27-demethylase activity using a chemical inhibitor and a demethylase-dead UTX knock-in mouse. Mechanistically dissection of the muscle regenerative process revealed that UTX is required for expression of the transcription factor Myogenin that drives differentiation of muscle progenitors. Thus we have identified a critical role for the enzymatic activity of UTX in activating muscle-specific gene expression during myofiber regeneration revealing for the first time that active H3K27-demethylation has a physiological role in vivo.	gene	Muscle satellite cells	GSM2039003,GSM2039004	GSM2039005,GSM2039006	2017-01-04 00:18:57			gene	GPL13112 ; GPL19057	GSE69968	Mus musculus	Knockin		UTX
101	CD	The histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferase Setdb1 is essential for both stem cell pluripotency and terminal differentiation of different cell types. To shed light on Setdb1 roles in these mutually exclusive processes we used mouse skeletal myoblasts as a model of terminal differentiation. Ex vivo studies on isolated single myofibres showed that Setdb1 is required for muscle adult stem cells expansion following activation. In vitro studies in skeletal myoblasts confirmed that Setdb1 suppresses terminal myoblast differentiation. Genomic binding analyses showed a release of Setdb1 from the promoter of selected target genes upon myoblast terminal differentiation concomitant to a nuclear export of Setdb1 to the cytoplasm. Both genomic release and cytoplasmic Setdb1 relocalisation during differentiation were dependent on canonical Wnt signalling. Together our findings revealed Wnt-dependent subcellular relocalisation of Setdb1 as a novel mechanism regulating Setdb1 functions and adult myogenesis.	gene	Skeletal muscle (C2C12 cells)	GSM1716675,GSM1716676,GSM1716677	GSM1716678,GSM1716679,GSM1716680	2017-01-04 00:19:03			gene	GPL13112	GSE70069	Mus musculus	Knockdown		Setdb1

Thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in the whole genome, and tend to located closely to protein-coding genes. To study position relationship between lncRNA and protein-coding genes, we classified all of lncRNA to several subgroups based on the genome position with their coding neighbors. XH, the head to head subgroup is associated with transcription and development in GO analysis. Here, we knockdown serveral XH lncRNA by shRNA in embryonic stem cells and induce nondirectional differnetiation by removing LIF or neural differnetiation by RA. Knockdown of XH lncRNAs led to uniform downregulation of nearby coding genes, and form regulatory circuits with its nearby coding genes to fine-tune embryonic lineage development. In addition, we also knockout one lncRNA-Evx1as and its nearby protein-coding gene-EVX1 by CRISPR, and get similar results as knockdown.We propose that XH lncRNA may function primarily as 'cis-regulators' of the expression of nearby protein-coding genes, and tend to participate in transcriptional or development regulations as their coding neighbors.	gene	CJ9 stem cells 	GSM1727251,GSM1727252	GSM1727253,GSM1727254,GSM1727255	2017-01-04 00:19:15			gene	GPL13112	GSE70419	Mus musculus	knockout		EVX1AS

106	CD	Establishment and differentiation of mammary alveoli during pregnancy are controlled by prolactin through the transcription factor STAT5. As pregnancy progresses mammary signature genes are activated in a defined temporal order, which coincides with the recruitment of STAT5 to respective regulatory sequences. This study addressed the question whether the methyltransferase and transcriptional co-activator EZH2 controls the differentiation clock of mammary epithelium. Ablation of Ezh2 from mammary stem cells resulted in precocious differentiation of alveolar epithelium during pregnancy and the activation of mammary-specific STAT5 target genes. This coincided with enhanced occupancy by STAT5, EZH1 and Pol II to these loci. Limited activation of differentiation-specific genes was also observed in mammary epithelium lacking both EZH2 and STAT5, suggesting a modulating but not mandatory role for STAT5. Notably, loss of EZH2 did not result in overt changes in genome-wide and gene-specific H3K27me3 patterns, suggesting that enhanced EZH1 recruitment can compensate for the loss of EZH2. Differentiated mammary epithelia failed to form in the combined absence of EZH1 and EZH2. Transplantation experiments failed to demonstrate a role for EZH2 in the biology of mammary stem and progenitor cells. In summary, while EZH1 and EZH2 serve redundant functions in the establishment of H3K27me3 and formation of mammary alveoli, the presence of EZH2 is required to obtain controlled temporal differentiation of mammary epithelium.	gene	Mammary gland	GSM1754921,GSM1754922,GSM1754923,GSM1754924,GSM1754925,GSM1754926	GSM1754909,GSM1754910,GSM1754911	2017-01-04 00:19:25			gene	GPL13112	GSE70440	Mus musculus	knockout		Ezh1

109	CD	Upon antigen recognition B cells undertake a bifurcated response in which some cells rapidly differentiate into plasmablasts while others undergo affinity maturation in germinal centers (GC). We uncover a double negative feedback loop between interferon regulatory factors IRF4 and IRF8 which regulates the initial bifurcation of activated B cells as well as the GC response. IRF8 dampens BCR signaling facilitates antigen specific interaction with helper T cells and promotes selection of high affinity clones while antagonizing IRF4 driven plasmablast differentiation. Genomic analysis reveals concentration dependent action of IRF4 and IRF8 in regulating distinctive gene expression programs. Stochastic modeling suggests that the double negative feedback is sufficient to initiate bifurcating B cell developmental trajectories.	gene	Spleen	GSM1816697,GSM1816698	GSM1816699,GSM1816700	2017-01-04 00:19:39			gene	GPL17021	GSE70711	Mus musculus	Knockout		IRF8

111	CD	Antibody-secreting plasma cells are the terminal stage of the B-cell lineage. Plasma cell differentiation requires a major resetting of gene expression to silence the B cell transcriptional program, whilst establishing secretory function and long-term survival. The transcription factors Blimp1 and Irf4 are essential for the initial differentiation of activated B cells to antibody-secreting cells, however their function in mature plasma cells remains elusive. We have found that while Irf4 was essential for plasma cell survival, Blimp1 was dispensable. Blimp1-deficient cells retained the unique plasma cell transcriptional signature, but lost the ability to secrete antibody or to maintain the characteristic size and ultrastructure of plasma cells. Blimp1 was required for full expression of many components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including Xbp1 and Atf6, as well as for the appropriate processing of Igh mRNA. The overlap of Blimp1 and Xbp1 function was restricted to the UPR genes, with Blimp1 uniquely regulating activity of the mTOR pathway, plasma cell size and morphology. These studies establish Blimp1 as a major regulator of the UPR pathway that is also required for the unique metabolic requirements of plasma cells enabling the secretion of protective antibody.	gene	Bone marrow 	GSM1824689,GSM1824690	GSM1824693,GSM1824694	2017-01-04 00:19:46		GSM1824691,GSM1824692	gene	GPL17021	GSE70981	Mus musculus	knockout		Blimp1
112	CD	PTBP1 and PTBP2 control alternative splicing programs during neuronal development, but the cellular functions of most PTBP1/2-regulated isoforms remain unknown. We show that PTBP1 guides developmental gene expression by regulating the transcription factor Pbx1. We identify exons that are differentially spliced when mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiate into neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons, and transition from PTBP1 to PTBP2 expression. We define those exons controlled by PTBP1 in ESCs and NPCs by RNA-seq analysis after PTBP1 depletion and PTBP1 crosslinking-immunoprecipitation. We find that PTBP1 represses Pbx1 exon 7 and the expression of its neuronal isoform Pbx1a in ESC. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete regulatory elements for exon 7, we induce Pbx1a expression in ESCs, finding that this activates transcription of specific neuronal genes including known Pbx1 targets. Thus PTBP1 controls the activity of Pbx1 and suppresses its neuronal transcriptional program prior to differentiation.	gene	Neuronal progenitor cell (mNPC)	GSM1824712,GSM1824707	GSM1824708,GSM1824709	2017-01-04 00:19:51			gene	GPL13112	GSE70985	Mus musculus	knockdown		Ptbp1

Integrating MeCP2 binding and DNA methylation in a probabilistic graphical model, we demonstrate that previously reported methylation preferences may be due to MeCP2’s affinity to GC-rich chromatin, a result replicated using published data. Furthermore, MeCP2 co-localized with nucleosomes, and Mecp2 deletion led to nucleosome repositioning.

120	CD	Abstract:The pRb tumor suppressor protein associates with chromatin and regulates gene expression. Numerous studies have identified Rb-dependent RNA signatures, but the proteomic effects of Rb-loss are largely unexplored. We have acutely ablated Rb in adult mice and conducted quantitative analysis of RNA and proteomic changes in colon and lung, where Rb-loss was sufficient or insufficient to induce ectopic proliferation respectively. As expected, RbKO caused similar increases in classic pRb/E2F-regulated transcripts in both tissues, but unexpectedly their protein products increased only in the colon, consistent with its increased proliferative index. Thus, these protein changes induced by Rb-loss are coupled with proliferation, but uncoupled from transcription. The proteomic changes in common between RbKO tissues showed a striking decrease in proteins with mitochondrial functions. Accordingly, RB1 inactivation in human cells decreased both mitochondrial mass and OXPHOS function. RBKO cells showed decreased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and the accumulation of hypopolarized mitochondria. Additionally, RB/Rb-loss altered mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation from 13C-Glucose through the TCA cycle in both cells and mouse tissues. Consequently, RBKO cells have an enhanced sensitivity to mitochondrial stress conditions. In summary, proteomic analyses provide a new perspective on Rb/RB1 mutation, highlighting the importance of pRb for mitochondrial function and suggesting vulnerabilities for treatment.	gene	Colon	GSM1847431,GSM1847432,GSM1847433	GSM1847434,GSM1847435,GSM1847436	2017-01-04 00:20:29			gene	GPL13112	GSE71924	Mus musculus	knockout		Rb1

122	CD	It has widely accepted that 5-methylcytosine is the only form of DNA methylation in mammalian genomes whereas the other forms such as N6-methyladenine primarily exist in prokaryotes and only a few eukaryotes. Herein we demonstrated the surprising presence of N6-methyladenine in mammalian genomes especially mouse embryonic stem cells. This modification is enriched at histone variant H2A.X-deposited genomic regions in wild type embryonic stem cells. Our work also showed that a previously unknown DNA demethylase Alkbh1 is the major demethylase for N6-methyladenine in embryonic stem cells. Increase of N6-methyladenine levels in Alkbh1 deficient cells leads to silencing of genes that regulate embryonic development. Surprisingly genes located on the X-chromosome but not the Y-chromosome or autosomes are preferentially silenced by N6-methyladenine. Strikingly N6-methyladenine in Alkbh1 deficient cells are specifically deposition at young full-length subfamilies of LINE1 transposons that are strongly enriched on the X chromosome. Furthermore N6-methyladenine deposition on LINE1s pattern is inversely correlated with their evolutionary age. The deposition of N6-methyladenine results in epigenetic silencing of such L1s which are otherwise actively transcribed in wild type embryonic stem cells and the neighboring enhancers and genes. Furthermore N6-methyladenine induced-silencing resists gene activation signals during embryonic stem cell differentiation. Thus N6-methyladenine adopts a new function in epigenetic silencing in evolution distinct from its role in gene activation in other organisms.

To better understand the function of Ctcfl we created tetracycline-inducible Ctcfl transgenic mice. We show that when Ctcfl expression is induced during embryogenesis it results in intrauterine growth retardation developmental eye malformations multi-organ pathologies vascular defects and early neonatal lethality. This phenotype resembles prior mouse models which perturb the TGFB pathway. Embryonic stem cells with the Ctcfl transgene reproduce the same phenotype in ES cell: tetraploid chimeras. RNA-Seq of the Ctcfl ES cells revealed 14 genes including a number of transcription factors/ co-activators and signal transduction pathway genes that are significantly deregulated by Ctcfl expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the TGFB pathway to be most affected by embryonic Ctcfl expression. We propose that our transgenic mice reiterate a developmental program normally reserved for spermatogenesis that results in multiple organ pathology when expressed in embryogenesis as a result of the TGFB pathway dysregulation. Understanding of the phenotypic consequence of Ctcfl expression in non-testicular cells and elucidating downstream targets of Ctcfl has the potential to explain its role as a cancer testis antigen (CTA) and its involvement in two if not more human vascular malformations.	gene		GSM1857103,GSM1857104	GSM1857101,GSM1857102	2017-01-04 00:20:42			gene	GPL13112	GSE72178	Mus musculus	Transgenic		Ctcfl
124	CD	RNA-binding proteins participate in a complex array of post-transcriptional controls essential to cell-type specification and somatic development. Despite their detailed biochemical characterizations, the degree to which each RNA-binding protein impacts on mammalian embryonic development remains incompletely defined and the level of functional redundancy among subsets of these proteins remains open to question. The poly-(C) binding proteins, Pcbp’s (aCPs, hnRNPEs), are encoded by a highly conserved and broadly expressed gene family. The two major Pcbp isoforms, Pcbp2 and Pcbp1, are robustly expressed in a wide range of tissues and exert both nuclear and cytoplasmic controls over gene expression. Here we report that Pcbp1-null embryos are rendered nonviable in the peri-implantation stage. In contrast, Pcbp2-null embryos survive until mid-gestation at which time they undergo a loss in viability associated with cardiovascular and hematopoietic abnormalities. Adult mice heterozygous for either Pcbp1 or Pcbp2 null alleles display a mild and non-disruptive growth defect. These data reveal that Pcbp1 and Pcbp2 are individually essential for mouse embryonic development and post-natal growth, reveal a non-redundant in vivo role for Pcpb2 in hematopoiesis, and provide direct evidence that Pcbp1, a retrotransposed derivative of Pcpb2, has evolved essential function(s) in the mammalian genome.	gene	Fetal liver 	GSM1863215,GSM1863216,GSM1863217,GSM1863218	GSM1863219,GSM1863220,GSM1863221	2017-01-04 00:20:49			gene	GPL17021	GSE72491	Mus musculus	knockout		Pcbp2

Currently mechanisms underlying the CNS phenotypes remain poorly understood. Here we show that Chd7 is a direct transcriptional target of oligodendrogenesis-promoting factors Olig2 and Brg1 and required for proper timing of CNS myelination and remyelination. Genome-occupancy analyses coupled with transcriptome profiling reveal that Chd7 cooperates with Sox10 to target the enhancers of key myelinogenic genes and identify novel Chd7 target.	gene	Spinal Cord	GSM1869164,GSM1869165	GSM1869166,GSM1869167	2017-01-04 00:20:52			gene	GPL13112	GSE72726	Mus musculus	Conditional Knockout		Chd7
126	CD	The integrity of chromatin which provides a dynamic template for all DNA-related processes in eukaryotes is maintained through replication-dependent and -independent assembly pathways. To address the role of replication-independent histone deposition we deleted the histone H3.3 chaperone Hira in developing mouse oocytes. We show that chromatin of non-replicative developing oocytes is highly dynamic and that lack of continuous H3.3/H4 deposition alters chromatin structure resulting in increased DNase I sensitivity the accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately a severe fertility phenotype. On the molecular level abnormal chromatin structure leads to a dramatic decrease in the dynamic range of gene expression the appearance of spurious transcripts and inefficient de novo DNA methylation. In contrast to the only minor transcriptional phenotype observed in mouse pluripotent cells we unequivocally show the importance of histone replacement and chromatin homeostasis for transcriptional regulation and normal developmental progression in an in vivo context.	gene	Oocyte	GSM1892302,GSM1892303,GSM1892304	GSM1892305,GSM1892306,GSM1892307,GSM1892308	2017-01-04 00:20:58			gene	GPL17021	GSE73381	Mus musculus	Knockout		Hira
127	CD	The sequential activation of distinct developmental gene networks governs the ultimate identity of a cell, but the mechanisms by which downstream programs are activated are incompletely understood. The preB-cell receptor (preBCR) is an important checkpoint of B-cell development and essential for a preB-cell to traverse into an immature B-cell. Here, we show that activation of Mef2 transcription factors by preBCR is necessary for initiating the subsequent genetic network. We demonstrate that B-cell development is blocked at the preB-cell stage in mice deficient for Mef2c and Mef2d transcription factors and that preBCR signaling enhances the transcriptional activity of Mef2c/d through phosphorylation by the ERK5 mitogen activating kinase. This activation is instrumental in inducing Krüppel-like factor 2 and several immediate early genes of the AP1 and Egr family. Finally, we show that Mef2 proteins cooperate with the products of their target genes (Irf4 and Egr2) to induce secondary waves of transcriptional regulation. Our findings uncover a novel role for Mef2c/d in coordinating the transcriptional network that promotes early B-cell development.	gene	proB-cells	GSM1897972,GSM1897973	GSM1897974,GSM1897975	2017-01-04 00:21:01			gene	GPL17021	GSE73560	Mus musculus	knockout		Klf2

133	CD	Conditional knockout of the transcription factor Ronin (Thap11) in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) results in a profound failure cell proliferation resulting in a hypoplastic adult retina that also suffers from photoreceptor degeneration. The goal of this study was to determine which genes are deregulated in response to loss of Ronin transcription factor activity in the developing retina. We generated Ronin flox/flox (Control) and Chx10-Cre::GFP+/tg; Ronin flox/flox (CKO) mice in which Ronin loss occurs specifically within RPCs and performed RNA-Seq analysis of embryonic day E14.5 (E14.5) retinae. Three independent pools of control and Ronin CKO retinae were collected consisting of a minimum of 10 retinae per pool and total RNA was extracted followed by polyA selection fractionation (200-500 nucleotide range) and generation of cDNA. The resulting DNA was then used for standard Illumina adaptor ligation and sequencing.

Conclusions: MN1 mediated leukemogenesis is associated with a gene expression program that dependes on Mll1 and Dot1l	gene	Common myeloid progenitors	GSM2037156,GSM2037157,GSM2037158	GSM2037159,GSM2037160	2017-01-04 00:23:12			gene	GPL13112	GSE76749	Mus musculus	Knockout		MLL1
151	CD	Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) governs genome-wide transcriptional programs. Using a new conditional knockout mouse, we found that Satb1 is required for normal differentiation of conventional dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, Satb1 governs the differentiation of inflammatory DCs by regulating MHC-II expression through Notch1 signaling. Mechanistically, Satb1 binds to the Notch1 promoter, activating Notch expression and driving RBPJ occupancy of the H2-Ab1 promoter, which activates MHC-II transcription. However, tumor-driven, unremitting expression of Satb1 in activated Zbtb46+ inflammatory DCs that universally infiltrate ovarian tumors results in an immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased secretion of tumor-promoting Galectin-1 and IL-6. Correspondingly, specific in vivo silencing of Satb1 in tumor-associated DCs reverses their tumorigenic activity and boosts protective immunity. Therefore, dynamic fluctuations in Satb1 expression govern the generation and immunostimulatory activity of steady-state and inflammatory DCs, but relentless Satb1 overexpression in differentiated DCs converts them into tolerogenic/pro-inflammatory cells that contribute to malignant progression.	gene	Cancer-Associated Dendritic Cells (DCs)	GSM2037720,GSM2037721	GSM2037722,GSM2037723	2017-01-04 00:23:16			gene	GPL13112	GSE76776	Mus musculus	knockdown		Satb1
152	CD	TDP-43 FUS and TAF15 are implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. We integrate CLIP-seq and RNA Bind-N-Seq technologies to discover that TAF15 binds to ~4 900 RNAs enriched for GGUA motifs. In the mouse brain TAF15 and FUS but not TDP-43 exhibit strikingly similar RNA binding profiles yet they alter the expression of distinct mRNA populations upon their individual depletions. TAF15 has a minimal role in alternative splicing and instead affects RNA turnover consistent with an enrichment of TAF15 binding sites in 3\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xaa untranslated regions. In human stem cell-derived motor neurons loss of both TAF15 and FUS affected mRNAs distinct from those altered by loss of either protein alone revealing redundant roles for TAF15 and FUS in maintaining mRNA levels. Furthermore concomitant rather than individual depletion of TAF15 and FUS more closely resembles RNA profiles of motor neurons derived from FUS R521G ALS patients or from late-stage sporadic ALS patients. Our study reveals convergent and divergent mechanisms by which FUS TAF15 and TDP-43 affects RNA metabolism in neurological disease.	gene	Striatum	GSM2056812,GSM2056813	GSM2056810,GSM2056811	2017-01-04 00:23:20			gene	GPL13112	GSE77703	Mus musculus	Knockdown		TAF15
153	CD	Precise control of mRNA decay is fundamental for robust yet not exaggerated inflammatory responses to pathogens. Parameters determining the specificity and extent of mRNA degradation within the entire inflammation-associated transcriptome remain incompletely understood. Using transcriptome-wide high resolution occupancy assessment of the mRNA-destabilizing protein TTP a major inflammation-limiting factor we qualitatively and quantitatively characterize TTP binding positions and functionally relate them to TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. We identify pervasive TTP binding with incompletely penetrant linkage to mRNA destabilization. A necessary but not sufficient feature of TTP-mediated mRNA destabilization is binding to 3\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xaa untranslated regions (UTRs). Mapping of binding positions of the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR in activated macrophages revealed that TTP and HuR binding sites in 3\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xaa UTRs occur mostly in different transcripts implicating only a limited co-regulation of inflammatory mRNAs by these proteins. Remarkably we identify robust and widespread TTP binding to introns of stable transcripts. Nuclear TTP is associated with spliced-out introns and maintained in the nucleus throughout the inflammatory response. Our study establishes a functional annotation of binding positions dictating TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. The findings allow navigating the transcriptome-wide landscape of RNA elements controlling inflammation.	gene	BMDM	GSM2069588,GSM2069589,GSM2069590	GSM2069591,GSM2069592,GSM2069593	2017-01-04 00:23:25			gene	GPL17021	GSE78209	Mus musculus	Knockout		TTP

157	CD	The insulin-like growth factor 2 antisense (Igf2as) gene is part of the Ins-Igf2-H19 imprinted gene cluster. The function of the paternally expressed Igf2as is still elusive.In our previous work we showed that Igf2as transcripts were located in the cytoplasm of C2C12 mouse myoblast cells associated with polysomes and polyadenylated suggesting that Igf2as is protein coding. In the present work the protein coding capacity of Igf2as was investigated. We demonstrate for the first time the existence of a polypeptide translated from an Igf2as construct. Furthermore an RNA-Seq analysis was performed using RNA prepared from skeletal muscles of newborn wild-type and \\\\x89\\\\xf6\\\\xa0DMR1-U2 mice to further elucidate the function of Igf2as transcripts. We found no evidence for a regulatory role of Igf2as in the imprinted gene cluster. Interestingly the RNA-Seq analysis indicated that Igf2as plays a role in the energy metabolism the cell cycle histone acetylation and muscle contraction pathways. Our Igf2as investigations further elucidated that there are two distinct Igf2as transcripts corresponding to two putative ORFs.	gene	Skeletal Muscle	GSM2113328,GSM2113329,GSM2113330,GSM2113331	GSM2113324,GSM2113325,GSM2113326,GSM2113327	2017-01-04 00:23:43			gene	GPL13112	GSE80128	Mus musculus	Knockout		DMR1-U2

165	CD	The circadian clock controls a wide variety of metabolic and homeostatic processes in a number of tissues, including the kidney. However, the role of the renal circadian clocks remains largely unknown. To address this question we performed transcriptomic analysis in mice with inducible and conditional ablation of the circadian clock system in the renal tubular cells (Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice). Deep sequencing of the renal transcriptome revealed significant changes in the expression of genes related to metabolic pathways and organic anion transport. In parallel, kidneys from Bmal1lox/lox/Pax8-rtTA/LC1 mice exhibited a significant decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio suggesting an increased anaerobic glycolysis and/or decreased mitochondrial function. In-depth analysis of two selected pathways revealed (i) a significant increase in plasma urea levels correlating with increased renal arginase 2 (Arg2) activity, hyperargininemia and increase of the kidney arginine content; (ii) a significantly increased plasma creatinine concentration and reduced capacity of the kidney to secrete anionic drugs (furosemide), paralleled by a ~80% decrease in the expression levels of organic anion transporter OAT3 (SLC22a8). Collectively, these results indicate that the renal circadian clocks control a variety of metabolic/homeostatic processes at both the intra-renal and systemic levels and are involved in drug disposition. 	gene	Renal tubular cells	GSM2038605,GSM2038606,GSM2038607	GSM2038608,GSM2038609,GSM2038610	2017-01-04 00:24:14			gene	GPL17021	GSE76838	Mus musculus	Knockout		BMAL1

Treatment of cells with Tranylcypromine (TCP), an inhibitor of histone demethylases, rescues the expression of approx. one third of the genes dysregulated by Tbx1 suppression and it rebalances H3K4me1 levels at many Tbx1 occupied sites.

168	CD	Insults to cellular health cause p53 protein accumulation and loss of p53 function leads to tumorigenesis. Thus, p53 has to be tightly controlled. Here we report that the BTB/POZ domain transcription factor PATZ1 (MAZR), previously known for its transcriptional suppressor functions in T lymphocytes, is a crucial regulator of p53. The novel inhibitory role of PATZ1 on the p53 protein marks it as a proto-oncogene. PATZ1 deficient cells have reduced proliferative capacity which we assess by RNASeq and real time cell growth rate analysis. PATZ1 modifies the expression of p53 target genes associated with cell proliferation gene ontology terms. Moreover, PATZ1 regulates several genes involved in cellular adhesion and morphogenesis. Significantly, treatment with the DNA damage inducing drug doxorubicin results in the loss of the PATZ1 transcription factor, as p53 accumulates. We find that PATZ1 binds to p53 and inhibits p53 dependent transcription activation. We examine the mechanism of this functional inhibitory interaction and demonstrate that PATZ1 excludes p53 from DNA binding. This study documents PATZ1 as a novel player in the p53 pathway.	gene	Embryonic fibroblasts	GSM1607997,GSM1607998,GSM1607999	GSM1608000,GSM1608001,GSM1608002	2017-01-04 00:24:26			gene	GPL13112	GSE65864	Mus musculus	Knockout		PATZ1

171	CD	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) develops predominantly through pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) precursor lesions. Pancreatic acinar cells are reprogrammed to a “ductal like” state during PanIN-PDA formation. Here, we demonstrate a parallel mechanism operative in mature duct cells where they undergo “ductal retrogression” to form IPMN-PDA. Brg1, a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complexes, plays a critical antagonistic role in IPMN-PDA development. In mature duct cells Brg1 inhibits the dedifferentiation that precedes neoplastic transformation, thus attenuating tumor initiation. In contrast, Brg1 promotes tumorigenesis in full-blown PDA by supporting a mesenchymal-like transcriptional landscape. We have exploited this duality of Brg1 functions to develop a novel therapeutic approach using an epigenetic drug JQ1. In summary, this study demonstrates the context-dependent roles of Brg1 and points to potential therapeutic treatment options based on epigenetic regulation in PDA.	gene	Duct cell	GSM1592341,GSM1592342,GSM1592343	GSM1592344,GSM1592345,GSM1592346	2017-01-04 00:24:39			gene	GPL13112	GSE65315	Mus musculus	Mutation		Kras(G12D)

Auf1-/- (KO) mice undergo accelerated skeletal muscle wasting with age and impaired muscle repair following injury. Satellite cell mRNA analysis and regeneration studies demonstrate that auf1-/- satellite cell self-renewal is impaired due to increased stability and overexpression of ARE-mRNAs. Control of ARE-mRNA decay by AUF1 and potentially other ARE-binding proteins represents a mechanism for adult stem cell regulation and is implicated in human muscle wasting diseases.

We also found that the absence of GTF2IRD1 is associated with increased expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation, including growth factors consistent with the observed phenotype of extreme thickening of the epidermis. At the same time, there was a decrease in the expression of genes involved in other signalling mechanisms, including the Wnt pathway, indicating dysregulation in the complex networks necessary for epidermal differentiation and facial skin patterning.

The goal of this study is to determine the function of and the genes regulated by Sox2 in the stomach. Methods: mRNA profiles of Sox2 WT and Sox2 KO gastric glands were generated by RNA-sequencing, in triplicate, using a Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument, resulting in 36 million single-end 50bp reads per smaple. Sequencing reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm10/GRCm38) using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Read counts over transcripts were calculated using HTSeq v.0.6.0 (Anders et al., 2015) based on a current Ensembl annotation file for mm10/GRCm38 (release 75). Results: Sox2 is dispensiable for gastric stem cell self-renewal and epithelial homeostasis, however modulates the expression of cancer and intestinal related genes.	gene	Stomach	GSM2224570,GSM2224571,GSM2224572	GSM2224573,GSM2224574,GSM2224575	2017-01-04 00:25:19			gene	GPL17021	GSE83964	Mus musculus	Knockout		Sox2
181	CD	De novo ASXL1 mutations are found in patients with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a disease with severe developmental defects and early childhood fatality. The underlying pathologic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using Asxl1-targeted murine models,we found that Asxl1 global loss or conditional deletion in osteoblasts and their progenitors in mice leads to significant bone loss and markedly decreased numbers of marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. Asxl1-/- MSPCs displayed impaired self-renewal and skewed differentiation-away from osteoblasts and favoring adipocytes. RNA-seq analysis reveals the altered expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, skeletal development and morphogenesis. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis showed a decreased gene expression of stem cell self-renewal signature,suggesting the role of Asxl1 in regulating the stemness of MSPCs. Importantly, introducing Asxl1 normalized NANOG and OCT4 expression and restored the self-renewal capacity of Asxl1-/- MSPCs. Our study unveils a pivotal role of ASXL1 in maintenance of MSPC functions and skeletal development.	gene	BM-derived Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs)	GSM1968342,GSM1968343	GSM1968344,GSM1968345	2017-01-04 00:25:22			gene	GPL17021	GSE75787	Mus musculus	Knockout		Asxl1
182	CD	Obesity is linked to the development of metabolic disorders. Expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) from hypertrophy of pre-existing adipocytes and/or differentiation of precursors into new mature adipocytes contributes to obesity. We found that Nck2 expression is largely restricted to WAT, raising the hypothesis that it may play a unique function in that tissue. Using mice lacking Nck2, we found that Nck2 regulates adipocyte hypertrophy thus contributing to increased adiposity and progressive glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. These findings were recapitulated in humans such that Nck2 expression in omental WAT was inversely correlated with the degree of obesity. Mechanistically, Nck2 deficiency promoted the induction of an adipocyte differentiation program and signaling by the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway in agreement with a role for the unfolded protein response in adipogenesis. These findings uncover Nck2 as a novel regulator of adipogenesis and that perturbation in its functionality contributes to adiposity-related metabolic disorders.	gene	Epididymal white adipose tissue	GSM1551260,GSM1551261	GSM1551262,GSM1551263	2017-01-04 00:25:26			gene	GPL13112	GSE63510	Mus musculus	Knockout		Nck2

184	CD	Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive type of lung cancer with early metastatic dissemination and invariable development of resistant disease for which no effective treatment is available to date. Mouse models of SCLC based on inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 developed earlier showed frequent amplifications of two transcription factor genes: Nfib and Mycl. Overexpression of Nfib but not Mycl in SCLC mouse results in an enhanced and altered metastatic profile, and appears to be associated with genomic instability. NFIB promotes tumor heterogeneity with the concomitant expansive growth of poorly differentiated, highly proliferative, and invasive tumor cell populations. Consistent with the mouse data, NFIB expression in high-grade human neuroendocrine carcinomas correlates with advanced stage III/IV disease warranting its further assessment as a potentially valuable progression marker in a clinical setting.	gene	Primary lung tumor-derived cells	GSM2179847,GSM2179849,GSM2179852,GSM2179853	GSM2179848,GSM2179850,GSM2179852,GSM2179854	2017-01-04 00:25:36			gene	GPL17021	GSE82005	Mus musculus	Overexpression		Nfib
185	CD	Despite significant advances in our understanding of the biology determining systemic energy homeostasis, the treatment of obesity remains a medical challenge. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been proposed as an attractive strategy for the treatment of obesity and its complications. AMPK is a conserved, ubiquitously expressed, heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase whose short-term activation has multiple beneficial metabolic effects. Whether these translate into long-term benefits for obesity and its complications is unknown. Here, we observe that mice with chronic AMPK activation, resulting from mutation of the AMPK γ2 subunit, exhibit ghrelin signalling-dependent hyperphagia, obesity and impaired pancreatic islet insulin secretion. Humans bearing the homologous mutation manifest a congruent phenotype. Our studies highlight that long-term AMPK activation can have adverse metabolic consequences with implications for pharmacological strategies seeking to chronically activate AMPK systemically to treat metabolic disease.	gene	Brain - Hypothalamic Arcuate Nucleus	GSM1893675,GSM1893676,GSM1893677,GSM1893678,GSM1893679	GSM1893680,GSM1893681,GSM1893682,GSM1893683,GSM1893684	2017-01-04 00:25:43			gene	GPL17021	GSE73436	Mus musculus	Knockin		AMPK R299Q

188	CD	miR-146a is a NF-κB induced microRNA that serves as a feedback regulator of this critical pathway. In mice, deficiency of miR-146a results in hematolymphoid cancer at advanced ages as a consequence of constitutive NF-κB activity. In this study, we queried whether the deficiency of miR-146a contributes to B-cell oncogenesis. Combining miR-146a deficiency with transgenic expression of c-Myc led to the development of highly aggressive B-cell malignancies. Mice transgenic for c-Myc and deficient for miR-146a were characterized by significantly shortened survival, increased lymph node involvement, differential involvement of the spleen and a mature B-cell phenotype. High-throughput sequencing of the tumors revealed significant dysregulation of approximately 250 genes. Amongst these, the transcription factor Egr1 was consistently upregulated in mice deficient for miR-146a. Interestingly, transcriptional targets of Egr1 were enriched in both the high-throughput dataset and in a larger set of miR-146a-deficient tumors. miR-146a overexpression led to downregulation of Egr1 and downstream targets with concomitant decrease in cell growth. Direct targeting of the human EGR1 by miR-146a was seen by luciferase assay. Together our findings illuminate a bona fide role for miR-146a in the modulation of B-cell oncogenesis and reveal the importance of understanding microRNA function in a cell- and disease-specific context.	gene	Emu-Myc 146a+/+ tumor cells	GSM1639213,GSM1639214,GSM1639215,GSM1639216	GSM1639217,GSM1639218	2017-01-04 00:25:58			gene	GPL17021	GSE67113	Mus musculus	Knockout		miR-146a
189	CD	Biallelic defects of the gene encoding for the intracellular enzyme 3’ repair exonuclease (Trex)1 cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a rare monogenic, lupus-like autoimmune disease, while heterozygous Trex1 loss of function alleles are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Trex1-/- mice develop lethal autoimmune multi-organ inflammation, which results from a chronic type I IFN response triggered by intracellular accumulation of a putative nucleic acid substrate of Trex1. This pathogenic nucleic acid is detected by the broadly, but not ubiquitously, expressed cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, raising the question whether there are specific cell types that respond to Trex1 deficiency by production of IFN and induce autoimmunity. We generated mice with conditional knock out of the Trex1 gene and demonstrated that loss of Trex1 throughout the hematopoietic system and even selective loss in dendritic cells is sufficient to cause IFN release and autoimmunity. B cells showed no transcriptional response to Trex1 deficiency. Trex1-/- keratinocytes produced IFN but did not induce skin inflammation, whereas loss of Trex1 in cardiomyocytes triggered neither IFN response nor pathology. Trex1-deficient neurons and astrocytes did not release IFN in the CNS. In contrast, mice with selective inactivation of Trex1 in long-living CNS macrophages such as microglia locally produced IFN but did not reproduce the mild encephalitis seen in Trex1-/- mice. Collectively, individual cell types differentially respond to the loss of Trex1 and dendritic cells seem promising candidates for experiments addressing the molecular pathomechanism in Trex1 deficiency.	gene	Spleenic B cells	GSM2056276,GSM2056277,GSM2056281	GSM2056275,GSM2056279	2017-01-04 00:26:03			gene	GPL17021	GSE77693	Mus musculus	Knockout		Trex1
190	CD	IRF8 and IRF1 are transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in the development and function of myeloid cells, including activation of macrophages by pro-inflammatory signals such as interferon gamma. Loss of IRF8 or IRF1 function causes severe susceptibility to infections in mice and in humans. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing in wild type, and in IRF8 and IRF1 mutant primary macrophages to systematically catalog all the genes bound by (cistromes) and transcriptionally activated (regulomes) by IRF8, IRF1, PU.1 and STAT1 including modulation of epigenetic histone marks. Of seven binding combinations identified, two (cluster 1: IRF8/IRF1/STAT1/PU.1; cluster 5: IRF1/STAT1/PU.1) were found to have a major role in controlling macrophage transcriptional programs both at basal level and following IFNγ activation. They direct expression of a set of genes, the IRF8/IRF1 regulome, that play critical roles in host inflammatory and anti-microbial defenses in mouse models of neuroinflammation and of pulmonary tuberculosis, respectively. In addition, this IRF8/IRF1 regulome is enriched for genes mutated in human primary immuno-deficiencies, and with loci associated for several inflammatory diseases in humans.	gene	Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM)	GSM2060977,GSM2060978	GSM2060979,GSM2060980	2017-01-04 00:26:07			gene	GPL13112	GSE77885	Mus musculus	Knockout		IRF1
191	CD	Canonical Wnt signaling output is mediated by β-catenin, which interacts with LEF/TCF transcription factors and recruits a general transcriptional activation complex to its C-terminus. Its N-terminus binds BCL9/9L proteins, which bind co-activators that in mammals contribute to fine-tuning the transcriptional output. We found that a BCL9/9L-dependent gene expression signature was strongly associated with patient outcome in colorectal cancer and that stem cell and mesenchymal genes determine its prognostic value. Abrogating BCL9/9L-β-catenin signaling in independent mouse colorectal cancer models resulted in virtual loss of these traits, and oncogenic intestinal organoids lacking BCL9/9L proteins proved no longer tumorigenic. Our findings suggest that the BCL9/9L arm of Wnt-β-catenin signaling sustains a stemness-to-differentiation equilibrium in colorectal cancer, which critically affects disease outcome. Mutational activation of the Wnt pathway is a key oncogenic event in colorectal cancer. Targeting the pathway downstream of activating mutations is challenging, and the therapeutic window is limited by intestinal toxicity. Contrasting with phenotypes caused by inactivating key Wnt pathway components, ablation of BCL9/9L proteins in adult mice indicated that they were dispensable for intestinal homeostasis, consistent with their role in tuning transcription. Cancer stem cells are increasingly recognized as responsible for tumor recurrence. The correlation between stemness traits in colorectal cancer models and BCL9/9L-β-catenin signaling suggests that high Wnt signaling output is required for their maintenance.

CdLS is a congenital genetic disorder distinguished by craniofacial dysmorphism, abnormal upper limb development, delayed growth, severe cognitive retardation, and multiple organ malformations.It has been suggested that CdLS is caused by defects in the cohesin network that alter gene expression and genome organization. However, the precise molecular etiology of CdLS is largely unclear.

201	CD	Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is characterized by anemia and cancer susceptibility, and is caused by mutations in ribosomal genes, including Rpl11. Here, we report that Rpl11-heterozygous embryos are not viable, and homozygous deletion of Rpl11 in adult mice results in death within a few weeks, accompanied by bone marrow aplasia and intestinal atrophy. Importantly, deletion of a single Rpl11 allele in adult mice results in anemia associated to decreased erythroid progenitors and defective erythroid maturation. These phenotypes are also present in mice transplanted with inducible heterozygous Rpl11 bone marrow, indicating a cell-autonomous role of RPL11 in erythropoiesis. Additionally, fibroblasts lacking one or both Rpl11 alleles show defective p53 activation upon ribosomal stress or DNA damage. Furthermore, fibroblasts and hematopoietic tissues from heterozygous Rpl11 mice present higher basal cMYC levels. Accordingly, heterozygous Rpl11 mice are highly susceptible to radiation-induced lymphomagenesis. We conclude that Rpl11-deficient mice recapitulate DBA disorder, including cancer predisposition.	gene	Hematopoietic progenitor cells	GSM1864268,GSM1864269,GSM1864270,GSM1864271	GSM1864272,GSM1864273,GSM1864274,GSM1864275	2017-01-04 00:27:09			gene	GPL13112	GSE72537	Mus musculus	Loss		Rpl11
202	CD	T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy characterized by infiltration of the bone marrow and other sites with transformed T cell progenitors. The role of tissue microenvironments in the pathogenesis of T-ALL or any other type of acute leukemia is little understood. In delineating interactions between T-ALL cells and their environment, we initially found that T-ALL cells express high surface levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Intravital imaging of an intact tibia revealed T-ALL cells in direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells producing the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12. Genetic targeting of CXCR4 on T-ALL cells resulted in a marked reduction of leukemia burden and prolonged disease remission, and disruption of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis using small molecule inhibitors prevented T-ALL progression in a primary xenograft model. Finally, we were able to show that CXCR4 inhibition significantly decreased expression of Myc and its target genes. Myc expression is a key regulator of T-ALL leukemia initiating cell (LIC) activity, suggesting that CXCR4 inhibition can suppress LIC activity by silencing the Myc response in T-ALL cells. Our data suggest that targeting of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling could be a powerful new tool for combating T-ALL, a disease with no current targeted therapies.	gene	T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells	GSM1477308,GSM1477309,GSM1477310	GSM1477311,GSM1477312,GSM1477313	2017-01-04 00:27:14			gene	GPL17021	GSE60367	Mus musculus	Knockout		Cxcr4
203	CD	Epigenetic changes, including histone methylation, control T cell differentiation and memory formation, though the enzymes that mediate these processes are not clear. We show that UTX, a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, promotes the generation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a CD4+ T cell subset essential for B cell antibody generation and clearance of chronic viral infections. Mice with T cell specific UTX deletion (UTX TKO mice) had fewer Tfh cells, showed defective germinal center formation, lacked virus-specific IgG production, and were unable to resolve chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. In UTX TKO T cells, decreased expression of IL-6R±, and other Tfh-related loci, was associated with increased H3K27 methylation. Additionally, Turner Syndrome subjects, who are predisposed to chronic ear infections, have reduced UTX expression in immune cells and decreased Tfh frequency. Thus, we identify a critical link between UTX in T cells and immunity to infection.	gene	Spleen	GSM1585345,GSM1585346,GSM1585347	GSM1585348,GSM1585349,GSM1585350	2017-01-04 00:27:20			gene	GPL13112	GSE64969	Mus musculus	Knockout		Utx
204	CD	The transcription factor RUNX1 is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. RUNX1 mutations can be early events, creating pre-leukemic stem cells that expand in the bone marrow. Here we show that, counter-intuitively, Runx1 deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a slow growth, low biosynthetic, small cell phenotype and markedly reduced ribosome biogenesis (Ribi). The reduced Ribi involves decreased levels of rRNA and many mRNAs encoding ribosome proteins. Runx1 appears to directly regulate Ribi; Runx1 is enriched on the promoters of genes encoding ribosome proteins, and binds the ribosomal DNA repeats. Runx1 deficient HSPCs have lower p53 levels, reduced apoptosis, an attenuated unfolded protein response, and accordingly are resistant to genotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The low biosynthetic activity and corresponding stress resistance provides a selective advantage to Runx1 deficient HSPCs, allowing them to expand in the bone marrow and outcompete normal HSPCs.	gene	Bone marrow	GSM1651906,GSM1651907	GSM1651908,GSM1651909	2017-01-04 00:27:24			gene	GPL17021	GSE67609	Mus musculus	Deficiency		Runx1
205	CD	Discreet defects during prenatal semilunar valve (SLV) development frequently progress to pathological states later in life and often require valve replacement surgery. As such, it is challenging to distinguish between the disrupted developmental processes, and their genetic and environmental influences, that trigger valve defects from mechanisms that drive the progression of an anatomically abnormal valve into a disease state. This distinction, which is essential to inform the rationale design of diagnostics and therapeutics, requires carefully characterizing when and where an implicated gene or pathway functions during valve development and/or homeostasis. Disrupted growth, differentiation, and patterning events that trigger SLV disease are coordinated by gene expression changes in endocardial, myocardial, and cushion mesenchymal cells. We explored the roles of chromatin regulation in valve gene regulatory networks via conditional inactivation of the mouse Brg1 associated factor (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex in the endocardial lineage. Endocardial Brg1-deficient embryos develop thickened and mal-patterned SLV cusps that frequently become bicuspid and myxomatous, including in surviving adults. These SLV disease-like phenotypes originate from deficient endocardial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in the proximal outflow tract (pOFT) cushions. Mesenchymal cells of neural crest or other cardiac origins subsequently replace the missing EMT-derived cells but are incompetent to pattern the valve interstitium into regions with distinct extracellular matrix composition. Transcriptomics reveal genes that may promote growth and patterning of SLVs and/or serve as biomarkers of their diseased state. Mechanistic studies of SLV disease genes will distinguish between disease origins and progression; the latter may largely reflect secondary responses to a disrupted developmental system.	gene	Heart (cardiac cushion)	GSM1656080,GSM1656082	GSM1656081,GSM1656083	2017-01-04 00:27:27			gene	GPL13112	GSE67786	Mus musculus	conditional Knockout		Brg1

208	CD	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of cell fate, and their mis-expression has been implicated in many diseases. While distinct polymerases generate messenger vs. noncoding ribosomal or tRNAs3, little is known about distinct mechanisms controlling lncRNA expression. Here we show that transcription of lncRNAs is quantitatively different from that of messenger RNAs (mRNAs)--as revealed by deficiency of Dicer (Dcr), a key ribonuclease that generates microRNAs (miRNAs). Loss of Dcr in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) led surprisingly to decreased level of the majority of lncRNAs. The canonical Dgcr8-Dcr-miRNA pathway is required for robust lncRNA expression, at the level of transcriptional initiation and elongation of lncRNA genes rather than at the level of their stability. cMyc, an oncogenic transcription factor, whose expression is indirectly regulated by Dcr-miRNA in mESCs, is partly responsible for lncRNA transcription. Loss of cMyc led to a more dramatic decrease of lncRNAs than mRNAs, and cMyc overexpression rescues lncRNA expression in Dcr KO cells. A quantitative metric of “mRNA-lncRNA decoupling” revealed that Dcr and cMyc differentially regulate lncRNAs vs. mRNAs in diverse cell types and in vivo, as evidenced by hundreds of microarray experiments. Thus, Dcr and cMyc may allow numerous lncRNAs to be activated or deactivated as a class, implicating lncRNAs to potential regulatory roles in development and disease states where Dcr and cMyc have been associated with.	gene	Embryonic stem cells	GSM1334363,GSM1334364	GSM1334360,GSM1334361,GSM1334362	2017-01-04 00:27:41			gene	GPL13112	GSE55338	Mus musculus	Knockout		Drc
209	CD	Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are found in most aggressive myeloid diseases and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Genetic and epigenetic alterations cause a dysregulated developmental program in leukemia. The MSI2 RNA binding protein has been previously shown to predict poor survival in leukemia. We demonstrate that the conditional deletion of Msi2 results in delayed leukemogenesis, reduced disease burden and a loss of LSC function. Gene expression profiling of the Msi2 ablated LSCs demonstrates a loss of the HSC/LSC and an increase in the differentiation program. The gene signature from the Msi2 deleted LSCs correlates with survival in AML patients. MSI2’s maintains the MLL self-renewal program by interacting with and retaining efficient translation of Hoxa9, Myc and Ikzf2. We further demonstrate that shRNA depletion of the MLL target gene Ikzf2 also contributes to MLL leukemia cell survival. Our data provides evidence that MSI2 controls efficient translation of the oncogenic LSC self-renewal program and a rationale for clinically targeting MSI2 in myeloid leukemia.	gene	Leukemia stem cells (LSCs)	GSM1573822,GSM1573823	GSM1573820,GSM1573821	2017-01-04 00:27:45			gene	GPL13112	GSE64545	Mus musculus	Knockout		Msi2

211	CD	Purpose: By integrating DNA methylation and gene expression of COPD lung tissues, we identified EPAS1 as a key regulator whose downstream genes significantly overlapped with multiple genes sets associated with COPD disease severity. EPAS1 is distinct in comparison with other key regulators in terms of methylation profiles and downstream target genes. Genes predicted to be regulated by EPAS1 were enriched for biological processes including signaling, cell communications, and system developement. As EPAS1 downstream genes were significantly enriched for hypoxia responsive genes in endothelial cells, we tested EPAS1 function in human and mouse endothelial cells HUVEC and C166. EPAS1 knockdown by siRNA in endothelial cells impacted genes that significantly overlapped with EPAS1 downstream genes in lung tissue including hypoxia responsive genes.  Methods: The cell lines of HUVEC (Lonza, MD, USA) and C166 (American Type Culture Collection, VA, USA) were cultured in the appropriate media at 37°C with 5% CO2. The cells were transfected with EPAS1 siRNA and non-targeting negative control siRNA (Life Technologies, CA, USA) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX as recommended transfection protocols by the manufacturer. After the treatments with 5nM Silencer® Select siRNA (s4700 for EPAS1, s65525 for Epas1; Life Technologies, USA) for 48 hours, the total RNA was purified with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). The efficiencies of knocked down the EPAS1 expression were assessed by qPCR with 1.4% for HUVEC, 3.2% for C166. Approximately 250 ng of total RNA per sample were used for library construction by the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument with 100nt single read setting according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence reads were aligned to human genome assembly hg19 and mouse genome assembly mm10, respectively, using Tophat [96]. Total 23,228 human and 22,609 mouse genes were quantified using Cufflinks [96]. siRNA signatures were derived by comparing expression profiles of EPAS1 or Epas1 siRNAs with non-targeting siRNAs at paired t-test p-value cutoff 0.05 with resulting signature sizes of 2,796 and 3,730, and corresponding q-values [97] 0.11 and 0.07 for HUVEC and C166, respectively. Results: When comparing endothelial cells treated with EPAS1 siRNAs and scrambled siRNAs, we identified an EPAS1 siRNA signature consisting of 2796 and 3730 genes in human and mouse endothelial cell lines, respectively, whose expression levels significantly changed (t-test p-value<0.05), including EPAS1 itself (p-value = 0.002 and 0.02) and the EPAS1 downstream target gene VEGFA (p-value = 0.03 and 0.01). The EPAS1 siRNA signatures derived from human and mouse cell lines were highly consistent, with 695 genes in common to both signatures (p-value = 7.2x10-65). Both signatures not only significantly overlapped with EPAS1 downstream genes (p-value = 7.3x10-7 and 1.5x10-12), but also with hypoxia response genes in endothelial cells (Fisher’s Exact Test p-value = 5.8x10-8 and 1.2x10-12 in the human and mouse signatures, respectively). Moreover, the EPAS1 siRNA signatures consistently overlapped genes associated with the COPD severity phenotypes. These results together validate that EPAS1 causally regulates the downstream target genes we predicted, and that these genes in turn affect COPD development and progression.	gene	Yolk sac	GSM1537564,GSM1537565,GSM1537566	GSM1537567,GSM1537568,GSM1537569	2017-01-04 00:27:54			gene	GPL17021	GSE62974	Mus musculus	Knockdown		EPAS1

214	CD	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a genetic cause of childhood obesity, is characterized by intellectual disabilities and sleep abnormalities. PWS-causing deletions include a neuronal long, non-coding RNA (lncRNA) processed into small nucleolar RNAs and a spliced lncRNA,116HG. We show that 116HG forms a subnuclear RNA cloud that co-purifies with the transcriptional activator RBBP5 and active metabolic genes, remains tethered to the site of its transcription and increases in size in postnatal neurons. Snord116del mice lacking 116HG exhibited increased energy expenditure corresponding to dysregulation of diurnally expressed Mtor and circadian genes Clock, Cry1, and Per2. Genomic and metabolic analyses demonstrate altered diurnal energy regulation in the Snord116del mouse cortex and link the loss of 116HG to the energy imbalance observed in PWS.	gene	Brain cortices	GSM1090263,GSM1090264	GSM1090265,GSM1090266	2017-01-04 00:28:07			gene	GPL13112	GSE43575	Mus musculus	Deletion		Snord116del
215	CD	Alternative splicing (AS) generates vast transcriptomic complexity in the vertebrate nervous system. However, the extent to which trans-acting splicing regulators and their target AS regulatory networks contribute to nervous system development is not completely understood. To address these questions, we have generated mice lacking the vertebrate- and neural-specific Ser/Arg-repeat related protein of 100 kDa (nSR100/SRRM4). Loss of nSR100 impairs development of the central and peripheral nervous systems, in part by disrupting neurite outgrowth, cortical layering in the forebrain, and axon guidance in the corpus callosum. Accompanying these developmental defects are widespread changes in AS that primarily result in shifts to non-neural patterns for different classes of splicing events. The main component of the altered AS program comprises 3-27 nucleotide neural microexons, an emerging class of highly conserved alternative splicing event associated with the regulation of protein interaction networks in developing neurons and neurological disorders. Remarkably, inclusion of a 6-nucleotide nSR100-activated microexon in Unc13b transcripts is sufficient to rescue a neuritogenesis defect in nSR100 mutant primary neurons. These results thus reveal critical in vivo neurodevelopmental functions of nSR100, and they further link these functions to a conserved program of neural microexon splicing.   	gene	Cortex	GSM1606722,GSM1606723,GSM1606724	GSM1606725,GSM1606726,GSM1606727	2017-01-04 00:28:12			gene	GPL17021	GSE65818	Mus musculus	Knockout		nSR100/Srrm4

217	CD	Purpose: berrantly high expression of TRIM24 occurs in human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, TRIM24 in the mouse is reportedly a liver-specific tumor suppressor. To address this dichotomy and uncover direct regulatory functions of TRIM24 in vivo, we developed a new mouse model that lacks expression of all Trim24 isoforms, as the previous model expresses normal levels of Trim24 lacking only exon 4. Methods: To produce germline-deleted Trim24dlE1 mice, deletion of the promoter and exon 1 of Trim24 was induced in Trim24LoxP mice by crossing with a zona pellucida 3-Cre line for global deletion. Liver-specific deletion (Trim24hep) was achieved by crossing with an Albumin-Cre line. Phenotypic analyses were complemented by protein, gene-specific and global RNA expression analyses and quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation. Results:Global loss of Trim24 disrupted hepatic homeostasis in 100% of mice with highly significant, decreased expression of oxidation/reduction, steroid, fatty acid and lipid metabolism genes, as well as increased expression of genes in unfolded protein, endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell cycle pathways. Trim24dlE1/dlE1 mice have markedly depleted visceral fat and, like Trim24hep/hep mice, spontaneously develop hepatic lipid-filled lesions, steatosis, hepatic injury, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions: TRIM24, an epigenetic co-regulator of transcription, directly and indirectly represses hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, fibrosis and damage in the murine liver. Complete loss of Trim24 offers a model of human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, steatosis, fibrosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of high-fat diet or obesity.	gene	Liver	GSM1496946,GSM1496947,GSM1496948	GSM1496949,GSM1496950,GSM1496951	2017-01-04 00:28:21			gene	GPL13112	GSE61117	Mus musculus	Knockout		Trim24

219	CD	3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an ubiquitous second messenger which regulates multiple physiological functions by acting in distinct subcellular microdomains. Although several targeted cAMP biosensors have been developed and used in cell lines or neonatal cardiomyocytes, it is unclear whether such biosensors can be successfully used in vivo, especially in the context of disease. Here, we generated the first transgenic mouse model expressing a targeted cAMP sensor (Epac1-PLN) and analyzed microdomain-specific second messenger dynamics in the vicinity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). We demonstrate the biocompatibility of this targeted sensor and its potential for real-time monitoring of compartmentalized cAMP signaling in adult cardiomyocytes isolated from healthy mouse heart and from in vivo cardiac disease model. Finally, we used gene arrays to verify that the mRNA expression levels of the main players involved in cAMP signaling such as beta-ARs, G-protein, adenylyl cyclases, PKAs, PDEs, and Epac were not significantly changed between wildtype and transgenic Epac1-PLN expressing cardiomyocytes.	gene	Cardiomyocytes	GSM1602500,GSM1602501,GSM1602502,GSM1602503,GSM1602504	GSM1602505,GSM1602506,GSM1602507,GSM1602508,GSM1602509	2017-01-04 00:28:32			gene	GPL13112	GSE65651	Mus musculus	Transgenic		Epac1-PLN transgenic
220	CD	Mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a major epigenetic regulator, are the predominant cause of Rett syndrome, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder. We previously found that Mecp2-null microglia are functionally impaired, and that engraftment of wild-type monocytes into the brain of Mecp2-deficient mice attenuates pathology. In this study we show that Mecp2 is expressed in macrophage and monocyte populations throughout the body, and is indispensable for their transcriptional regulation in multiple contexts. We demonstrate that Mecp2-null mice progressively lose or are chronically deficient in several macrophage populations and resident monocytes. Postnatal re-expression of Mecp2 driven by a tamoxifen-inducible CX3CR1 promoter significantly increased the lifespan of otherwise Mecp2-null mice, suggesting that epigenetic regulation of macrophage function by Mecp2 significantly contributes to pathology. RNA-Seq of acutely isolated microglia and peritoneal macrophages (to our knowledge, the first cell-specific RNA-Seq analysis comparing Mecp2-null and wild type cells of any kind) revealed significantly increased transcription of glucocorticoid- and hypoxia-signaling genes in Mecp2-null cells compared to that in their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that Mecp2 functions as a repressor of these pathways. Furthermore, in-vitro and in vivo validation studies demonstrated that the absence of Mecp2 is associated with cell-intrinsic dysfunction of signaling underlying inflammatory activation, suggesting that Mecp2 is important for regulation of specific macrophage gene-expression programs in response to stimuli and stressors. Our findings demonstrate a fundamental role for Mecp2 in the regulation of macrophage functions, which may provide a link to pathologies in Rett syndrome across multiple organs.	gene	Microglia	GSM1617046,GSM1617047,GSM1617052,GSM1617053,GSM1617054,GSM1617055	GSM1617048,GSM1617049,GSM1617056	2017-01-04 00:28:38			gene	GPL13112	GSE66211	Mus musculus	Null		Mecp2

228	CD	In animals the organization of the compact mitochondrial genome and lack of introns have necessitated a unique mechanism for RNA processing. To date the regulation of mitochondrial RNA processing and its importance for ribosome biogenesis and energy metabolism are not clear. To understand the in vivo role of the endoribonuclease component of the RNase P complex, MRPP3, we created conditional knockout mice. Here we show that MRPP3 is essential for life, and heart and skeletal muscle-specific knockout leads to a cardiomyopathy early in life, indicating that it is the only RNase P enzyme in mitochondria. We show that RNA processing is required for the biogenesis of the respiratory chain and mitochondrial function. Transcriptome-wide parallel analyses of RNA ends (PARE) and RNA-Seq enabled us to identify the in vivo cleavage sites of RNase P. Cleavage of the 5′ tRNA ends precedes 3′ end processing in vivo and is required for the correct biogenesis of the mitochondrial ribosomal subunits and mitoribosomal proteins that are differentially stabilized or degraded in the absence of mature rRNAs. Finally we identify that large mitoribosomal proteins can form a subcomplex on a precursor mt-RNA containing the 16S rRNA indicating that mitoribosomal biogenesis proceeds co-transcriptionally. Taken together our data show that RNA processing links transcription to translation via assembly of the mitoribosome.	gene	Heart	GSM2203962,GSM2203963,GSM2203964	GSM2203965,GSM2203966,GSM2203967	2017-01-04 00:29:34	GSM2203972,GSM2203973,GSM2203971	GSM2203969,GSM2203968,GSM2203970	gene	GPL13112	GSE83471	Mus musculus	Knockout		Mrpp3
229	CD	Purpose: RNA editing by ADAR1 is essential for hematopoietic development. The goals of this study were firstly, to identify ADAR1-specific RNA-editing sites by indentifying A-to-I (G) RNA editing sites in wild type mice that were not edited or reduced in editing frequency in ADAR1 deficient murine erythroid cells. Secondly, to determine the transcription consequence of an absence of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing. Methods: Total RNA from E14.5 fetal liver of embryos with an erythroid restricted deletion of ADAR1 (KO) and littermate controls (WT), in duplicate. cDNA libraries were prepared and RNA sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. A-to-I (G) RNA editing sites were identified as previously described by Ramaswami G. et al., Nature Methods, 2012 using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA). RNA editing sites were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 14,484 transcripts in the fetal livers of WT and ADAR1E861A mice with BWA. RNA-seq data had a goodness of fit (R2) of >0.7, p<0.0001 between biological duplicates per genotype. Clusters of hyper-editing were onserved in long, unannotated 3'UTRs of erythroid specific transcripts. A profound upregulation of interferon stimulated genes were found to be massively upregulated (up to 5 log2FC) in KO fetal liver compared to WT. 11.332 (6,894 novel) A-to-I RNA editing sites were identified when assessing mismatches in RNA-seq data. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of erythroid transcriptomes and A-to-I RNA editing sites, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. A-to-I RNA editing is the essential function of ADAR1 and is required to prevent sensing of endogenous transcripts, likely via a RIG-I like receptor mediated axis.	gene	Fetal liver	GSM1825985,GSM1825986	GSM1825983,GSM1825984	2017-01-04 00:29:38			gene	GPL13112	GSE71042	Mus musculus	Knockout		ADAR
230	CD	Adult-onset diseases can be associated with in utero events, but mechanisms for this remain unknown. The polycomb histone methyltransferase, Ezh2, stabilizes transcription by depositing repressive marks during development that persist into adulthood, but its function in postnatal organ homeostasis is unknown. We show that Ezh2 stabilizes cardiac gene expression and prevents cardiac pathology by repressing the homeodomain transcription factor Six1, which functions in cardiac progenitors but is stably silenced upon cardiac differentiation. Ezh2 deletion in cardiac progenitors caused postnatal myocardial pathology and destabilized cardiac gene expression with activation of Six1-dependent skeletal muscle genes. Six1 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and skeletal muscle gene expression. Furthermore, genetically reducing Six1 levels rescued the pathology of Ezh2-deficient hearts. Thus, Ezh2-mediated repression of Six1 in differentiating cardiac progenitors is essential for stable postnatal heart gene expression and homeostasis. Our results suggest that epigenetic dysregulation in embryonic progenitor cells predisposes to adult disease and dysregulated stress responses.	gene	Heart	GSM846188,GSM846189	GSM846186,GSM846187	2017-01-04 00:29:42			gene	GPL13112	GSE34274	Mus musculus	Deficient		Ezh2

241	CD	ZFP57 is necessary for maintaining repressive epigenetic modifications at Imprinting control regions (ICRs). In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), ZFP57 binds ICRs (ICRBS) and many other loci (non-ICRBS). To address the role of ZFP57 on all its target sites, we performed high-throughput and multi-locus analyses of inbred and hybrid mouse ESC lines carrying different gene knockouts. By using an allele-specific RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate that ZFP57 loss results in derepression of the imprinted allele of multiple genes in the imprinted clusters. We also find marked epigenetic differences between ICRBS and non-ICRBS suggesting that different cis-acting regulatory functions are repressed by ZFP57 at these two classes of target loci. Overall, these data demonstrate that ZFP57 is pivotal to maintain the allele-specific epigenetic modifications of ICRs that in turn are necessary for maintaining the imprinted expression over long distances. At non-ICRBS, ZFP57 inactivation results in acquisition of epigenetic features that are characteristic of poised enhancers, suggesting that another function of ZFP57 in early embryogenesis is to repress cis-acting regulatory elements whose activity is not yet required.	gene	Embryonic stem cells	GSM2051878,GSM2051880	GSM2051879,GSM2051881	2017-01-04 00:30:37			gene	GPL17021	GSE77441	Mus musculus	Knockout		Zfp57
242	CD	Ribosome stalling during translation has recently been shown to cause neurodegeneration, yet the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are unknown. To investigate these pathways we analyzed the brain of B6J-nmf205-/- mice in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNA Arg(UCU) tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. Increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ser51) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these mice and transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Further we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in B6J-nmf205-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.	gene	Cerebellum	GSM2108676,GSM2108677,GSM2108678	GSM2108679,GSM2108680,GSM2108681	2017-01-04 00:30:42			gene	GPL13112	GSE79929	Mus musculus	Knockout		nmf205

FBXL10 is expressed as two isoforms: FBXL10-1, a longer form that contains an N-terminal JmjC domain with C- terminal F-box, CXXC, PHD, RING, and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains, and FBXL10-2, a shorter form that initiates at an alternative internal exon and which lacks the JmjC domain but retains the other domains. Selective deletion of Fbxl10-1 had been reported to produce a minor and variable phenotype, and most mutant animals were essentially normal. We show here that deletion of Fbxl10-2 (in a manner that does not perturb expression of Fbxl10-1) resulted in a very different phenotype with craniofacial abnormalities, greatly increased lethality, and female sterility in surviving homozygous mutants. The phenotype of the Fbxl10-2 deletion was more severe in female mutants. We found that mutants that lacked both FBXL10-1 and -2 showed embryonic lethality and even more extreme sexual dimorphism, with more severe gene dysregulation in mutant female embryos. X-linked genes were most severely dysregulated, and there was marked overexpression of Xist in mutant females although genes that encode factors that bind to Xist RNA were globally down-regulated in mutant female as compared to male embryos.

252	CD	The multiple claims about reactivation of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency factor OCT4 in somatic cells are highly controversial due to the fact that there is no direct evidence that OCT4 has a functional role in cells other than ESCs. Herein we demonstrate that smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific knockout of Oct4 within atherosclerotic mice resulted in increased lesion size and multiple changes consistent with decreased plaque stability. SMC-lineage tracing studies showed that lesions from SMC-specific conditional Oct4 KO mice had a reduced number of SMCs likely due to impaired SMC migration. RNA-seq analysis of lesion specimens showed that loss of Oct4 in SMCs was associated with marked activation of genes associated with inflammation and suppression of genes associated with cell migration, a number of which were shown to be activated in cultured SMCs by the combination of hypoxia and oxidized phospholipids in an OCT4-dependent manner. Activation of Oct4 within SMCs was associated with hydroxymethylation of the Oct4 promoter and was HIF1α- and KLF4-dependent. Results provide the first genetic evidence that OCT4 plays a functional role in somatic cells and highlight the importance of further investigation of possible OCT4 functions in somatic cells.	gene	Atherosclerosis lesion	GSM1941379,GSM1941380,GSM1941381,GSM1941382	GSM1941375,GSM1941376,GSM1941377,GSM1941378	2017-01-04 00:31:34			gene	GPL13112	GSE75044	Mus musculus	 Knockout		Oct4

256	CD	We previously found that mice deficient in the CD susceptibility gene Nod2 develop small intestinal abnormalities including impaired mucus production by goblet cells and susceptibility to injury, which were associated with interferon-gamma producing intraepithelial lymphocytes. These abnormalities were caused by a striking expansion of a common member of the microbiota, Bacteroides vulgatus. Remarkably, infection of Nod2-deficient mice with the helminth Trichuris muris led to a TH2 response that eliminated B. vulgatus colonization and intestinal abnormalities. In addition, treatment with recombinant IL13 (rIL13) or recombinant IL4 reduced B. vulgatus levels and eliminated goblet cell defects, suggesting that type 2 cytokines alone can reverse intestinal abnormalities in the absence of helminth infection. To determine the mechanism by which type 2 cytokines protected Nod2-/- mice from intestinal abnormalities, we performed RNA-seq on small intestinal tissue from WT, Nod2-/- and rIL13 treated Nod2-/- mice. We found that rIL13 treatment induced a wound healing response characterized by M2 macrophage activation genes. Hence, type 2 cytokines can reverse inflammatory imbalances in the composition of the gut microbiota that occurs in a genetically susceptible host.	gene	Small intestine	GSM2027190,GSM2027191,GSM2027192,GSM2027193,GSM2027194	GSM2027195,GSM2027196,GSM2027197,GSM2027198	2017-01-04 00:31:57			gene	GPL13112	GSE76504	Mus musculus	Knockout		Nod2

258	CD	Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) are non-circulating memory T cells that localize to portals of pathogen entry such as the skin, gut and lung where they provide efficient early protection against reinfection. Trm are characterized by a molecular profile that actively prevents egress from peripheral sites including the constitutive expression of the lectin CD69 and down-regulation of the chemokine receptor (CCR)7 and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). This program is partially mediated by down-regulation of the transcription factor KLF2; however, to date no transcriptional regulator specific to Trm has been identified. Here we show that the Blimp1 related transcription factor Hobit is specifically upregulated in Trm and together with Blimp1, mediates the development and maintenance of Trm in various tissues including skin, gut, liver and kidney. Importantly, we found that the Hobit/Blimp1 transcriptional module is also required for other tissue-resident lymphocytes including Natural Killer T (NKT) cells and liver tissue-resident NK cells (trNK). We show that these populations share a universal transcriptional program with Trm instructed by Hobit and Blimp1 that includes the repression of CCR7, S1PR1 and KLF2 thereby enforcing tissue retention. Our results identify Hobit and Blimp1 as major common regulators that drive the differentiation of distinct populations of tissue-resident lymphocytes.	gene	Bone marrow	GSM1819909,GSM1819905,GSM1819901	GSM1819910,GSM1819906,GSM1819902	2017-01-04 00:32:07			gene	GPL17021	GSE70813	Mus musculus	Knockout		Hobit

276	CD	Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed against BCR-ABL1, the product of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, have revolutionized treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, acquired resistance to TKIs is a significant clinical problem in CML, and TKI therapy is much less effective against Ph+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). BCR-ABL1, via phosphorylated Tyr177, recruits the adapter GAB2 as part of a GRB2/GAB2 complex. We showed previously that GAB2 is essential for BCR-ABL1-evoked myeloid transformation in vitro. Using a genetic strategy and mouse models of CML and B-ALL, we show here that GAB2 is essential for myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1. In the mouse model, recipients of BCR-ABL1-transduced Gab2-/- bone marrow failed to develop CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia. Leukemogenesis was restored by expression of GAB2 but not by GAB2 mutants lacking binding sites for its effectors PI3K or SHP2. GAB2 deficiency also attenuated BCR-ABL1-induced B-ALL, but only the SHP2 binding site was required. The SHP2 and PI3K binding sites were differentially required for signaling downstream of GAB2. Hence, GAB2 transmits critical transforming signals from Tyr177 to PI3K and SHP2 for CML pathogenesis, whereas only the GAB2-SHP2 pathway is essential for lymphoid leukemogenesis. Given that GAB2 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, GAB2 and its effectors PI3K and SHP2 represent promising targets for therapy in Ph+ hematologic neoplasms.	gene	Bone Marrow	GSM1960526,GSM1960527,GSM1960528	GSM1960529,GSM1960530,GSM1960531	2017-01-04 00:33:31			gene	GPL13112	GSE75615	Mus musculus	Knockout		GAB2

370	CD	Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare in vitro polarized T helper 17 cell transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) in different genetic background. Methods: Th17 mRNA profiles of 96hrs in vitro cultured T helper 17 cells from wild-type and mutant mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina RapidRun. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and TopHat followed by CuffDiff. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results: Among the 325 genes that were significantly dysregulated in DDX5-deficient T cells, approximately 40% were previously identified as RORγt targets in Th17 cells. 96 RORγt-dependent Th17 cell genes co-regulated by Rmrp together with DDX5. Conclusions: Our study suggest that the DDX5-Rmrp axis is critical for expression of a critical subset of the RORγt transcriptional targets in Th17 cells.	gene	Th17 cells	GSM1717174,GSM1717176,GSM1717179	GSM1717175,GSM1717177	2017-01-04 01:11:25			gene	GPL17021	GSE70108	Mus musculus	Knockout		DDX5
371	CD	Background & Aims: Perturbations in pancreatic ductal bicarbonate secretion often result in chronic pancreatitis. Although the physiological mechanism of ductal secretion is known, its transcriptional control is not well characterized. Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor Hematopoietically-expressed homeobox protein (Hhex) in pancreatic secretion and pancreatitis. Methods: We derived mice with pancreas-specific, Cre-mediated Hhex gene ablation to determine the requirement of Hhex in the pancreatic duct in early life and in adult stages. Histological and immunostaining analyses were used to detect the presence of pathology. Pancreatic primary ductal cells (PDCs) were isolated to discover differentially expressed transcripts upon acute Hhex ablation. Results: Hhex protein was detected throughout the embryonic and adult ductal trees. Ablation of Hhex in pancreatic progenitors resulted in postnatal ductal ectasia associated with acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, a progressive phenotype that ultimately resulted in chronic pancreatitis. Hhex ablation in adult mice, however, did not cause any detectable pathology. Ductal ectasia did not result from perturbations in primary cilia, but was consistent with the effects of primary ductal hypertension. RNA-seq analysis of Hhex-ablated PDCs indicated the G-protein coupled receptor Natriuretic peptide receptor 3, implicated in paracrine signaling, was upregulated 4.70-fold. Conclusions: Although Hhex is dispensable for adult pancreatic function, ablation of Hhex in pancreatic progenitors results in profound pancreatitis that is consistent with primary ductal hypertension. Our data highlight the critical role of paracrine signaling in maintaining ductal homeostasis, especially in early life, and support ductal hypersecretion as a novel etiology of pediatric chronic pancreatitis.	gene	Primary mouse pancreatic ductal cells	GSM1551774,GSM1551775	GSM1551776,GSM1551777	2017-01-04 01:11:28			gene	GPL13112	GSE63526	Mus musculus	Knockout		Hhex

402	CD	The clearance of oxidative stress compounds is critical for the protection of the organism from malignancy, but how this key physiological process is regulated is not fully understood. Here we found that the expression of GPRC5A, a well-characterized tumor suppressor in lung cancer, was elevated in colorectal cancer tissues in patients. In both cancer cell lines and a colitis-associated cancer model in mice, we found that GPRC5A deficiency reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis as well as inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Through RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis, we identified oxidative stress associated pathways were dysregulated. Moreover, in GPRC5A deficient cells and mouse tissues, the oxidative agents were reduced partially due to increased glutathione (GSH) level. Mechanistically, GPRC5A regulates NF-κB mediated Vanin-1 expression which is the predominant enzyme for cysteamine synthesis. Administration of cystamine (the disulfide form of cysteamine) in GPRC5A deficient cell lines inhibited γ-GCS activity leading to restoration of GSH level and increase of cell growth. Taken together, our studies suggest that GPRC5a is a potential biomarker for colon cancer and promotes tumorigenesis through stimulation of Vanin-1 expression and oxidative stress in colitis associated cancer. This study revealed an unexpected oncogenic role of GPRC5A in colorectal cancer suggesting there are complicated functional and molecular mechanism differences of this gene in distinct tissues.	gene	colorectal cancer tissues	GSM2310017,GSM2310018,GSM2310019	GSM2310020,GSM2310021,GSM2310022	2017-01-04 01:14:09			gene	GPL13112	GSE86895	Mus musculus	Knockout		Gprc5a
403	CD	Impaired estrogen receptor α (ERα) action promotes obesity and metabolic dysfunction in humans and mice; however, the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain unknown. Considering that skeletal muscle is a primary tissue responsible for glucose disposal and oxidative metabolism, we established that reduced ERα expression in muscle is associated with glucose intolerance and adiposity in women and female mice. To test this relationship, we generated muscle-specific ERα knockout (MERKO) mice. Impaired glucose homeostasis and increased adiposity were paralleled by diminished muscle oxidative metabolism and bioactive lipid accumulation in MERKO mice. Aberrant mitochondrial morphology, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and impairment in basal and stress-induced mitochondrial fission dynamics, driven by imbalanced protein kinase A–regulator of calcineurin 1–calcineurin signaling through dynamin-related protein 1, tracked with reduced oxidative metabolism in MERKO muscle. Although muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abundance was similar between the genotypes, ERα deficiency diminished mtDNA turnover by a balanced reduction in mtDNA replication and degradation. Our findings indicate the retention of dysfunctional mitochondria in MERKO muscle and implicate ERα in the preservation of mitochondrial health and insulin sensitivity as a defense against metabolic disease in women.	gene	Muscle -  Quadriceps	GSM2304959,GSM2304960,GSM2304961	GSM2304962,GSM2304963,GSM2304964	2017-01-04 01:14:14			gene	GPL13112	GSE86520	Mus musculus	Knockout		Erα

Parameters determining the specificity and extent of mRNA degradation within the entire inflammation-associated transcriptome remain incompletely understood. Using transcriptome-wide high resolution occupancy assessment of the mRNA-destabilizing protein TTP a major inflammation-limiting factor we qualitatively and quantitatively characterize TTP binding positions and functionally relate them to TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. We identify pervasive TTP binding with incompletely penetrant linkage to mRNA destabilization. A necessary but not sufficient feature of TTP-mediated mRNA destabilization is binding to 3\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xaa untranslated regions (UTRs). Mapping of binding positions of the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR in activated macrophages revealed that TTP and HuR binding sites in 3\\\\x89\\\\xdb\\\\xaa UTRs occur mostly in different transcripts implicating only a limited co-regulation of inflammatory mRNAs by these proteins. Remarkably we identify robust and widespread TTP binding to introns of stable transcripts.

408	CD	Precise control of mRNA decay is fundamental for robust yet not exaggerated inflammatory responses to pathogens. Parameters determining the specificity and extent of mRNA degradation within the entire inflammation-associated transcriptome remain incompletely understood. Using transcriptome-wide high resolution occupancy assessment of the mRNA-destabilizing protein TTP a major inflammation-limiting factor we qualitatively and quantitatively characterize TTP binding positions and functionally relate them to TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages.

409	CD	Through the analysis of mouse liver tumours promoted by distinct routes (DEN exposure alone DEN exposure plus non-genotoxic insult with phenobarbital and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease); we report that the cancer associated hyper-methylated CGI events in mice are also predicated by silent promoters that are enriched for both the DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the histone modification H3K27me3 in normal liver. During cancer progression these CGIs undergo hypo-hydroxymethylation prior to subsequent hyper-methylation; whilst retaining H3K27me3. A similar loss of promoter-core 5hmC is observed in Tet1 deficient mouse livers indicating that reduced Tet1 binding at CGIs may be responsible for the epigenetic dysregulation observed during hepatocarcinogenesis. Consistent with this reduced Tet1 protein levels are observed in mouse liver tumour lesions. As in human DNA methylation changes at CGIs do not appear to be direct drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma progression in mice. Instead dynamic changes in H3K27me3 promoter deposition are strongly associated with tumour-specific activation and repression of transcription. Our data suggests that loss of promoter associated 5hmC in diverse liver tumours licences DNA methylation reprogramming at silent CGIs during cancer progression.	gene	Liver	GSM2057961,GSM2057962	GSM2057963,GSM2057964	2017-01-04 01:40:39			drug	GPL17021	GSE77729	Mus musculus		Phenobarbital

414	CD	Ctcfl a paralog of Ctcf also known as BORIS (Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites) is a testis expressed gene whose function is largely unknown. As a cancer testis antigen it is often expressed in tumor cells and also seen in two benign human vascular malformations juvenile angiofibromas (JA) and infantile hemangiomas (IH). To better understand the function of Ctcfl we created tetracycline-inducible Ctcfl transgenic mice. We show that when Ctcfl expression is induced during embryogenesis it results in intrauterine growth retardation developmental eye malformations multi-organ pathologies vascular defects and early neonatal lethality. This phenotype resembles prior mouse models which perturb the TGFB pathway. Embryonic stem cells with the Ctcfl transgene reproduce the same phenotype in ES cell: tetraploid chimeras. RNA-Seq of the Ctcfl ES cells revealed 14 genes including a number of transcription factors/ co-activators and signal transduction pathway genes that are significantly deregulated by Ctcfl expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the TGFB pathway to be most affected by embryonic Ctcfl expression. We propose that our transgenic mice reiterate a developmental program normally reserved for spermatogenesis that results in multiple organ pathology when expressed in embryogenesis as a result of the TGFB pathway dysregulation. Understanding of the phenotypic consequence of Ctcfl expression in non-testicular cells and elucidating downstream targets of Ctcfl has the potential to explain its role as a cancer testis antigen (CTA) and its involvement in two if not more human vascular malformations.	gene	Embryonic stem cells	GSM1857103,GSM1857104	GSM1857105,GSM1857106	2017-01-04 01:41:20			drug	GPL13112	GSE72178	Mus musculus		Doxycycline

416	CD	Aging and increased amyloid burden are major risk factors for cognitive diseases such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). An effective therapy does not yet exist. Here we use mouse models for age-associated memory impairment and amyloid deposition to study transcriptome and cell type-specific epigenome plasticity at the systems level in the brain and in peripheral organs. We show that at the level of epigenetic gene-expression aging and amyloid pathology are associated with inflammation and impaired synaptic function in the hippocampal CA1 region. While inflammation is associated with increased gene-expression that is linked to a subset of transcription factors de-regulation of plasticity genes is mediated via different mechanisms in the amyloid and the aging model. Amyloid pathology impairs histone-acetylation and decreases expression of plasticity genes while aging affects differential splicing that is linked to altered H4K12 acetylation at the intron-exon junction in neurons but not in non-neuronal cells. We furthermore show that oral administration of the clinically approved histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat not only restores spatial memory but also exhibits an anti-inflammatory action and reinstates epigenetic balance and transcriptional homeostasis at the level of gene expression and exon usage. This is the first systems-level investigation of transcriptome plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region in aging and AD models and of the effects of an orally dosed histone deacetylase inhibitor. Our data has important implications for the development of minimally invasive and cost-effective therapeutic strategies against age-associated cognitive decline.

Triplicate cultures of the IDG-SW3 cells were then treated with 50nM PTH (1-34) or vehicle control (PBS) for 24 hours. RNA was harvested from the cultures and used to perform RNA Seq analysis. We found that many genes previously shown to be markers of the osteocyte phenotype were strongly downregulated in response to PTH treatment. Furthermore we found that genes known to inhibit cell motility were downregulated in response to PTH whereas genes promoting motility were upregulated. This corresponds to the increased cell motility observed in PTH-treated IDG-SW3 cell cultures. Therefore PTH induces a switch in mature IDG-SW3 cells from a osteocyte-like cell to a more motile phenotype.	gene	Osteocyte	GSM1502765,GSM1502766,GSM1502767	GSM1502768,GSM1502769,GSM1502770	2017-01-04 01:42:04			drug	GPL13112	GSE61351	Mus musculus		Parathyroid hormone

436	CD	Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are emerging cellular components of the skeletal muscle regenerative environment. The alternative functional phenotype of FAPs - either supportive of muscle regeneration or promoting fibro-adipogenic degeneration - is a key determinant in the pathogenesis of muscular diseases including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). However the molecular regulation of FAPs is still unknown. We show here that an HDAC-myomiR-BAF60 variant network regulates the functional phenotype of FAPs in dystrophic muscles of mdx mice. Combinatorial analysis of gene expression microarray and genome-wide chromatin remodeling by Nuclease accessibility (NA)-seq revealed that HDAC inhibitors de-repress a latent myogenic program in FAPs from dystrophic muscles at early stages of disease progression. In these cells HDAC inhibition promoted the expression of two core components of the myogenic transcriptional machinery MyoD and BAF60C and upregulated the myomiRs (miRs) miR-1.2 miR-133 and miR-206 which target two alternative BAF60 variants (BAF60A and B) ultimately leading to the activation of a pro-myogenic program at the expense of the fibro-adipogenic phenotype. By contrast FAPs from dystrophic muscles at late stages of disease progression displayed resistance to HDACi-induced chromatin remodeling at myogenic loci and fail to activate the pro-myogenic phenotype. These results reveal a previously unappreciated disease stage-specific bipotency of mesenchimal cells within the regenerative environment of dystrophic muscles. Resolution of such bi-potency by epigenetic interventions such as HDACi provides the molecular rationale for the in situ reprogramming of target cells to promote therapeutic regeneration of dystrophic muscles.	gene	Skeletal muscle	GSM1255495,GSM1255496	GSM1255497,GSM1255498	2017-01-04 01:43:35			drug	GPL17021	GSE51933	Mus musculus		Trichostatin A	
437	CD	Transcriptomics data obtained from limiting amounts of mRNA is often noisy providing primarily qualitative changes in transcript expressions. So far technical variations arising out of the library preparation protocols have not been adequately characterized at reduced levels of mRNA. Here we generated sequencing libraries from limiting amounts of mRNA using three amplification-based methods viz. Smart-seq DP-seq and CEL-seq and demonstrated significant technical variations in these libraries. Reduction in mRNA levels led to inefficient amplification of the majority of low to moderately expressed transcripts. Furthermore stochasticity in primer hybridization and/or enzyme incorporation was magnified during the amplification step resulting in significant distortions in fold changes of the transcripts. Consequently the majority of the differentially expressed transcripts identified were either high-expressed and/or exhibited high fold changes. High technical variations which were sequencing depth independent ultimately masked subtle biological differences mandating the development of improved amplification-based strategies for quantitative transcriptomics from limiting amounts of mRNA.	gene	Embryonic stem cells	GSM1231196,GSM1231197	GSM1231194,GSM1231195	2017-01-04 01:43:39			drug	GPL13112	GSE50856	Mus musculus		Activin A

Mice were untreated or were treated with cyclophosphamide (CPA) given on a 6-day repeating metronomic schedule (CPA/6d), except as noted. Results from these global transcriptome analysis indicated substantial elevation of basal GL261 immune infiltration and strong activation by CPA/6d treatment of GL261 immune stimulatory pathways and their upstream regulators, but without preferential depletion of negative immune regulators compared to LLC and B16F10 tumors. In LLC tumors, where CPA/6d treatment was found to be anti-angiogenic, CPA/6d suppressed VEGFA target genes and down regulated cell adhesion and leukocyte transendothelial migration genes. In GL261 tumors implanted in adaptive immune-deficient scid mice, where CPA/6d-induced GL261 regression is incomplete and late tumor growth rebound can occur, T cell receptor signaling and certain cytokine-cytokine receptor responses seen in B6 mice were deficient.

442	CD	AD drug discovery has rarely been addressed in the context of aging even though sporadic AD accounts for 99% of the cases. Phenotypic screens based upon old age-associated brain toxicities were used to develop the potent AD drug candidate J147. Here, we hypothesized that J147 would be effective against both brain aging and AD-associated pathology in rapidly aging SAMP8 mice, a model for early sporadic AD. An inclusive and integrative multi-omics approach was used to investigate protein expression, RNA expression, metabolite levels as well as cognition in old and young SAMP8 mice. J147 not only reduced the cognitive deficits and associated metabolic changes observed in old SAMP8 mice, it restored the levels of multiple markers of AD, vascular pathology, synaptic function, and inflammation to those approaching the young phenotype. Our data show that a drug candidate selected upon the basis of preventing old age-related brain toxicities also reduces AD-associated pathology.	gene	Brain (SAMP8 mice)	GSM1696059,GSM1696060,GSM1696061	GSM1696062,GSM1696063,GSM1696064	2017-01-04 01:43:58			drug	GPL17021	GSE69244	Whole transcriptome analysis o		J147	
443	CD	We used wild-type 129 mice to understand the mechanism of action behind SRT3025’s hematopoiesis-enhancing effect. Transcriptome analysis of cKit+ Sca1+ Lin- cells (KSL) cells discovered that a list of genes changed their expression levels significantly after SRT3025 administration in wild-type mice. Most notably, the cell cycle regulator p21 was down-regulated by 2.1 fold after SRT3025 administration. It is possible that the transcriptional suppression of p21 by SRT3025 might contribute to the compound’s beneficial effects on hematopoiesis. It has to be pointed out that, since our transcriptome analysis was limited to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell population, we cannot rule out the possibility that SRT3025 works through the regulation of other cells such as certain important HSC niche components. The HSC niche is known to regulate stem cell pool size. Among the other genes suppressed by SRT3025, Thbs1 and Fosl2 encode thrombospondin 1 and Fos-like antigen 2, respectively. Both proteins are components of the HSC niche.	gene	cKit+ Sca1+ Lin- cells (KSL)	GSM1493968,GSM1493969,GSM1493970	GSM1493971,GSM1493972,GSM1493973	2017-01-04 01:44:03			drug	GPL13112	GSE60941	Mus musculus		SRT3025	
444	CD	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER. The cellular response to ER stress involves complex transcriptional and translational changes, important to the survival of the cell. ER stress is a primary cause and a modifier of many human diseases. A first step to understanding how the ER stress response impacts human disease is to determine how the transcriptional response to ER stress varies among individuals. The genetic diversity of the eight mouse Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains allowed us to determine how genetic variation impacts the ER stress transcriptional response. We used tunicamycin, a drug commonly used to induce ER stress, to elicit an ER stress response in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the CC founder strains and measured their transcriptional responses. We identified hundreds of genes that differed in response to ER stress across these genetically diverse strains. Strikingly, inflammatory response genes differed most between strains; major canonical ER stress response genes showed relatively invariant responses across strains. To uncover the genetic architecture underlying these strain differences in ER stress response, we measured the transcriptional response to ER stress in MEFs derived from a subset of F1 crosses between the CC founder strains. We found a unique layer of regulatory variation that is only detectable under ER stress conditions. Over 80% of the regulatory variation under ER stress derives from cis-regulatory differences. This is the first study to characterize the genetic variation in ER stress transcriptional response in the laboratory mouse. Our findings indicate that the ER stress transcriptional response is highly variable among strains and arises from genetic variation in individual downstream response genes, rather than major signaling transcription factors.

Drug inhibition of Clk SR-protein kinase activity triggered rapid splicing changes in a specific set of DIs, about half of which showed increased splicing and half increased intron detention, altering the transcript pool of over 300 genes.

454	CD	Multiple sclerosis involves an aberrant autoimmune response and progressive failure of remyelination in the central nervous system. Prevention of neural degeneration and subsequent disability requires remyelination through the generation of new oligodendrocytes, but current treatments exclusively target the immune system. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are stem cells in the central nervous system and the principal source of myelinating oligodendrocytes. These cells are abundant in demyelinated regions of patients with multiple sclerosis, yet fail to differentiate, thereby representing a cellular target for pharmacological intervention. To discover therapeutic compounds for enhancing myelination from endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, we screened a library of bioactive small molecules on mouse pluripotent epiblast stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Here we show seven drugs function at nanomolar doses selectively to enhance the generation of mature oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells in vitro. Two drugs, miconazole and clobetasol, are effective in promoting precocious myelination in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures, and in vivo in early postnatal mouse pups. Systemic delivery of each of the two drugs significantly increases the number of new oligodendrocytes and enhances remyelination in a lysolecithin-induced mouse model of focal demyelination. Administering each of the two drugs at the peak of disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis results in striking reversal of disease severity. Immune response assays show that miconazole functions directly as a remyelinating drug with no effect on the immune system, whereas clobetasol is a potent immunosuppressant as well as a remyelinating agent. Mechanistic studies show that miconazole and clobetasol function in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase and glucocorticoid receptor signalling, respectively. Furthermore, both drugs enhance the generation of human oligodendrocytes from human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vitro. Collectively, our results provide a rationale for testing miconazole and clobetasol, or structurally modified derivatives, to enhance remyelination in patients.	gene	Embryonic stem cells	GSM1557628,GSM1557629	GSM1557630,GSM1557631	2017-01-04 01:44:47			drug	GPL17021	GSE63804	Mus musculus		Clobetasol

460	CD	In mouse embryonic cells, a retinoic acid (RA) stimulation triggers a massive change of gene expression leading the pluripotent, proliferating cells to a lineage-specific differentiation process. The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) plays a key role in this response by inhibiting pluripotency-maintaining genes and simultaneously activating some major actors of cell differentiation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this dual regulation, we performed joint RAR/RXR ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq time series during the first 48 hours of the RA-induced Primitive Endoderm differentiation process in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells. We detected significantly more RAR/RXR binding regions than previous studies and identified among them a handful of typical binding intensity patterns during differentiation. We demonstrate that these patterns are correlated with the coincidental binding of essential transcription factors (TFs) for pluripotency maintenance or PrE differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells, as well as the presence of variants of RAR binding motifs. Most importantly, early-bound regions coincide with pluripotency-associated transcription factor binding in ES (like Pou5f1, Sox2, Esrrb and Nr5a2) and display an increased frequency of the DR0 type RAR binding motifs; late-bound sites are associated to the PrE marker Sox17 and are enriched in the canonical DR5 binding motif. Our data offer an unprecedently detailed view on the action of RA in triggering pluripotent cell differentiation. Altogether, this work sheds light on the relocation of RAR/RXR binding sites throughout differentiation, and shows how RAR/RXR progressively shift from DR0 enriched regions, which were specifically identified in undifferentiated models, to canonical RAR binding sites containing loci.	gene	Embryonal carcinoma cell line	GSM1370733,GSM1370734,GSM1370735	GSM1370739	2017-01-04 01:45:07	GSM1370738	GSM1370732	drug	  GPL11002; GPL13112	GSE56893	Mus musculus		All-trans retinoic acid

464	CD	RORγt is a transcription factor required for T helper 17 (Th17) cell development. We identified three RORγt-specific inhibitors that suppress Th17 cell responses including Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We systemically characterized RORγt binding data in the presence and absence of drug with corresponding whole-transcriptome sequencing for wild-type and RORγt-deficient cells. RORγt is central in a densely interconnected regulatory network, acting both as a direct activator of genes important for Th17 cell differentiation and as a direct repressor of genes from other T-cell lineages. The three inhibitors identified here reversed both of these modes of action, but to varying extents and through distinct mechanisms. Whereas one inhibitor displaced RORγt from its target-loci, the two more potent inhibitors affected transcription predominantly without removing DNA-binding. Our work illustrates the power of a system-scale analysis of transcriptional regulation to characterize potential therapeutic compounds that inhibit pathogenic Th17 cells and suppress autoimmunity.	gene	Th17 cells	GSM1357524,GSM1357530	GSM1357525,GSM1357531	2017-01-04 01:45:20			drug	GPL13112	GSE56240	Mus musculus		TMP778

Collectively, our results provide a rationale for testing miconazole and clobetasol, or structurally modified derivatives, to enhance remyelination in patients.	gene	Embryonic stem cells	GSM1557640,GSM1557641	GSM1557644,GSM1557645	2017-01-04 01:46:25			drug	GPL17021	GSE63804	Mus musculus		Miconazole	
470	CD	In mouse embryonic cells, a retinoic acid (RA) stimulation triggers a massive change of gene expression leading the pluripotent, proliferating cells to a lineage-specific differentiation process. The retinoic acid receptor (RAR) plays a key role in this response by inhibiting pluripotency-maintaining genes and simultaneously activating some major actors of cell differentiation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this dual regulation, we performed joint RAR/RXR ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq time series during the first 48 hours of the RA-induced Primitive Endoderm differentiation process in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells. We detected significantly more RAR/RXR binding regions than previous studies and identified among them a handful of typical binding intensity patterns during differentiation. We demonstrate that these patterns are correlated with the coincidental binding of essential transcription factors (TFs) for pluripotency maintenance or PrE differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells, as well as the presence of variants of RAR binding motifs. Most importantly, early-bound regions coincide with pluripotency-associated transcription factor binding in ES (like Pou5f1, Sox2, Esrrb and Nr5a2) and display an increased frequency of the DR0 type RAR binding motifs; late-bound sites are associated to the PrE marker Sox17 and are enriched in the canonical DR5 binding motif. Our data offer an unprecedently detailed view on the action of RA in triggering pluripotent cell differentiation. Altogether, this work sheds light on the relocation of RAR/RXR binding sites throughout differentiation, and shows how RAR/RXR progressively shift from DR0 enriched regions, which were specifically identified in undifferentiated models, to canonical RAR binding sites containing loci.	gene	Embryonal carcinoma cell line	GSM1370733,GSM1370734,GSM1370735	GSM1370739	2017-01-04 01:46:28	GSM1370738	GSM1370732	drug	  GPL11002; GPL13112	GSE56893	Mus musculus		All-trans retinoic acid

474	CD	RORγt is a transcription factor required for T helper 17 (Th17) cell development. We identified three RORγt-specific inhibitors that suppress Th17 cell responses including Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We systemically characterized RORγt binding data in the presence and absence of drug with corresponding whole-transcriptome sequencing for wild-type and RORγt-deficient cells. RORγt is central in a densely interconnected regulatory network, acting both as a direct activator of genes important for Th17 cell differentiation and as a direct repressor of genes from other T-cell lineages. The three inhibitors identified here reversed both of these modes of action, but to varying extents and through distinct mechanisms. Whereas one inhibitor displaced RORγt from its target-loci, the two more potent inhibitors affected transcription predominantly without removing DNA-binding. Our work illustrates the power of a system-scale analysis of transcriptional regulation to characterize potential therapeutic compounds that inhibit pathogenic Th17 cells and suppress autoimmunity.	gene	Th17 cells	GSM1357524,GSM1357530	GSM1357525,GSM1357531	2017-01-04 01:46:39			drug	GPL13112	GSE56240	Mus musculus		TMP778

476	CD	Increasing evidence supports a role for altered gene expression in mediating the lasting effects of cocaine on the brain, and recent work has demonstrated the involvement of chromatin modifications in these alterations. However, all such studies to date have been restricted by their reliance on microarray technologies which have intrinsic limitations. Here, we used advanced sequencing methods, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, to obtain an unprecedented view of cocaine-induced changes in gene expression and associated adaptations in numerous modes of chromatin regulation in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region. We identify unique combinations of chromatin changes, or signatures, that accompany cocaine’s regulation of gene expression, including the dramatic involvement of pre-mRNA alternative splicing in cocaine action. Together, this delineation of the cocaine-induced epigenome in the nucleus accumbens reveals several novel modes of drug regulation, thereby providing new insight into the biological basis of cocaine addiction. More broadly, the combinatorial chromatin and transcriptional approaches that we describe serve as an important resource for the field, as they can be applied to other systems to reveal novel transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of neuronal regulation.	gene	Nucleus accumbens	GSM1050257,GSM1050258,GSM1050259	GSM1050254,GSM1050255,GSM1050256	2017-01-04 01:48:58			drug	GPL13112	GSE42805	Mus musculus		Cocaine	
477	CD	Topoisomerases are necessary for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, and are mutated in some patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have studied the effects of inhibitors of Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) and Topoisomerase 2 (Top2) enzymes on mouse cortical neurons. We find that topoisomerases selectively inhibit long genes (>100kb), with little effect on all other gene expression. Using ChIPseq against RNA Polymerase II (Pol2) we show that the Top1 inhibitor topotecan blocks transcriptional elongation of long genes specifically. Many of the genes inhibited by topotecan are candidate ASD genes, leading us to propose that topoisomerase inhibition might contribute to ASD pathology.	gene	Cortical neurons	GSM1064933,GSM1064934,GSM1064935,GSM1064936,GSM1064937	GSM1064938,GSM1064939,GSM1064940,GSM1064941,GSM1064942	2017-01-04 01:49:05			drug	GPL11154; GPL13112 	GSE43526	Mus musculus		Topotecan

479	CD	Counter to the long-held belief that DNA methylation of terminally differentiated cells is permanent and essentially immutable, post-mitotic neurons exhibit extensive DNA demethylation. The causal role of active DNA demethylation in neurons, however, is not known. Tet family proteins oxidize 5-methylcytosine to initiate active DNA demethylation through the base-excision repair pathway. Here, we show that synaptic activity bi-directionally regulates neuronal Tet3 expression. Functionally, knockdown of Tet or inhibition of base-excision repair in hippocampal neurons elevates excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission, whereas overexpressing Tet3 or Tet1 catalytic domain decreases it. Furthermore, dysregulation of Tet3 signalling prevents homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Mechanistically, Tet3 dictates neuronal surface GluR1 levels. RNA-seq analyses further revealed a pivotal role of Tet3 in regulating gene expression in response to global synaptic activity changes.

481	CD	Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the most common cause of childhood blindness worldwide and is caused by oxygen therapy necessary to prevent mortality after premature birth. We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of systemic hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) stabilization through HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibition (HIF PHi) in protecting retinal vasculature from oxygen toxicity in a mouse model of ROP or oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR). We definitively demonstrated that hepatic HIF-1 can be activated to confer this protection using systemic dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) to prevent HIF-1α degradation. In this study we compare Roxadustat, a small molecule stabilizer of HIF-1 currently in phase 3 clinical trials for increasing erythropoiesis in adult patients with chronic kidney disease, to DMOG. We demonstrate that Roxadustat induces vascular protection during hyperoxia to induce the coordinated sequential growth of retinal vasculature with a 3-fold reduction in oxygen induced capillary loss (p-=0.001). In order to define the molecular mechanism of protection, we further compared the transcriptome of both liver and retina after systemic treatment with Roxadustat or DMOG. Similar gene expression profiles were identified in liver but very different effects on transcription were found in retinal tissues because Roxadustat, in contrast to DMOG, directly targets retina, confirmed by western blot and by rescue of the hepatic HIF-1 KO, two criteria that DMOG treatment is unable to fulfill. Systems pharmacologic analysis demonstrates that Roxadustat induces typical HIF regulated genes critical to aerobic glycolysis in liver and retinal tissues whereas DMOG, acting through either secreted hepatokines or by influence of systemic DMOG, downregulates cell adhesion/extracellular matrix interaction pathways while increasing expression of histone cluster genes. Stratification of liver transcriptomes to secreted gene products again shows close consensus of hepatic genes induced by both small molecules, and includes upregulation of a plethora of angiogenic proteins such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), erythropoietin (EPO), and orosomucosoid 2 (ORM2). Secondary validation of these transcripts by serum ELISA confirms secretion of EPO and PAI-1 into blood from liver. These findings definitively demonstrate that HIF stabilization can prevent OIR by two pathways: direct retinal HIF stabilization and induction of aerobic glycolysis or indirect, hepatic HIF-1 stabilization and increased serum angiokines. Systems pharmacology analysis therefore explains why intermittent, low dosage of small molecule HIF stabilizers creates a profound protective phenotype, because both pathways can take advantage of cytoprotection induced by the liver and by retina synergistically. These data provide a rationale for considering low dose, intermittent systemic administration of Roxadustat, currently in phase 3 trials in adults with chronic kidney disease, to eradicate ROP in children.	gene	Liver	GSM1912580,GSM1912581,GSM1912582,GSM1912583,GSM1912584,GSM1912585	GSM1912586,GSM1912587,GSM1912588,GSM1912589,GSM1912590,GSM1912591	2017-01-04 01:49:31			drug	GPL17021	GSE74170	Mus musculus		DMOG

485	CD	Osteoarthritis is a common joint disorder that causes debilitating conditions among the elderly. Risk factors of osteoarthritis include age, which is often associated with the thinning of articular cartilage. We generated conditional knockout mice that lack salt-inducible kinase 3 (Sik3) specifically in chondrocytes after birth by tamoxifen administration. Deletion of Sik3 at 2 or 8 weeks after birth increased the thickness of articular cartilage by increasing the chondrocyte population. Additionally, Sik3 deletion protected cartilage against osteoarthritis development. We identified the edible Pteridium aquilinum ingredient, pterosin B, as a compound that inhibits the Sik3 pathway. Intraarticular injection of pterosin B protected cartilage against osteoarthritis development. Sik3 deletion or pterosin B treatment inhibited activation of the hypertrophic program through the histone deacetylase 4 (Hdac4) pathway, increased Prg4 expression in chondrocytes, and protected cartilage against osteoarthritic attack. Collectively, our results suggest Sik3 is a regulator that regulates homeostasis of articular cartilage thickness and a target for treatment of osteoarthritis, and that pterosin B can be the lead compound for relevant drugs.	gene	Chondrocyte	GSM1971603,GSM1971604,GSM1971605	GSM1971606,GSM1971607,GSM1971608	2017-01-04 01:49:56			drug	GPL17021	GSE75995	Mus musculus		pterosin B	
486	CD	Purpose: Chronic pulmonary inflammation in the form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been consistently shown to increase the risk of lung cancer. Therefore, identification of chemopreventive agents with anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic activities, is indispensable. Recently, we found that combinations of silibinin (Sil) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) significantly inhibited lung tumorigenesis induced by 4-(methylnitro-samino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and enhanced by chronic treatment with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we described gene expression profiling of lung tissues using RNA-seq to determine the gene expression signature in inflammation-driven lung tumors and modulation of this signature by the chemopreventive agents Sil and I3C. Methods: Total RNA extracted from lung tissues of control and treated mice were processed for mRNA sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed for transcript abundance at the gene level using CLC Bio Genomics Workbench and differential gene expression analysis was performed using the built-in Empirical Analysis of Differential Gene Expression (DGE) based on 'Exact Test' method. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Results and conclusions: We found that 330, 2,957, and 1,143 genes were differentially regulated in mice treated with NNK, LPS, and NNK + LPS, respectively. The expression of inflammation-and immunity-related genes was significantly more deregulated in lung tissues of mice treated with LPS alone compared to mice treated with NNK + LPS. Among 1,143 genes differentially regulated in the NNK + LPS group, the expression of 162 genes and associated signaling pathways were significantly modulated by I3C and/or Sil + I3C. These genes include cytokines, chemokines, and genes with a well-established role in inflammation and/or tumorigenesis such as c-ros oncogene 1 (Ros1), the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and epiregulin, Cyp1a1, and the circadian rhythm genes Arntl, and Npas2. To our knowledge, this is the first report that provides insight into genes that are differentially expressed during inflammation-driven lung tumorigenesis and the modulation of these genes by chemopreventive agents.	gene	Lung	GSM1563063,GSM1563064,GSM1563065	GSM1563066,GSM1563067,GSM1563068	2017-01-04 01:50:01			drug	GPL13112	GSE64027	Mus musculus		NNK	
487	CD	Purpose: Chronic pulmonary inflammation in the form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been consistently shown to increase the risk of lung cancer. Therefore, identification of chemopreventive agents with anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic activities, is indispensable. Recently, we found that combinations of silibinin (Sil) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) significantly inhibited lung tumorigenesis induced by 4-(methylnitro-samino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and enhanced by chronic treatment with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we described gene expression profiling of lung tissues using RNA-seq to determine the gene expression signature in inflammation-driven lung tumors and modulation of this signature by the chemopreventive agents Sil and I3C.

488	CD	IRF8 and IRF1 are transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in the development and function of myeloid cells, including activation of macrophages by pro-inflammatory signals such as interferon gamma. Loss of IRF8 or IRF1 function causes severe susceptibility to infections in mice and in humans. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing in wild type, and in IRF8 and IRF1 mutant primary macrophages to systematically catalog all the genes bound by (cistromes) and transcriptionally activated (regulomes) by IRF8, IRF1, PU.1 and STAT1 including modulation of epigenetic histone marks. Of seven binding combinations identified, two (cluster 1: IRF8/IRF1/STAT1/PU.1; cluster 5: IRF1/STAT1/PU.1) were found to have a major role in controlling macrophage transcriptional programs both at basal level and following IFNγ activation. They direct expression of a set of genes, the IRF8/IRF1 regulome, that play critical roles in host inflammatory and anti-microbial defenses in mouse models of neuroinflammation and of pulmonary tuberculosis, respectively.

490	CD	T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy characterized by infiltration of the bone marrow and other sites with transformed T cell progenitors. The role of tissue microenvironments in the pathogenesis of T-ALL or any other type of acute leukemia is little understood. In delineating interactions between T-ALL cells and their environment, we initially found that T-ALL cells express high surface levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Intravital imaging of an intact tibia revealed T-ALL cells in direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells producing the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12. Genetic targeting of CXCR4 on T-ALL cells resulted in a marked reduction of leukemia burden and prolonged disease remission, and disruption of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis using small molecule inhibitors prevented T-ALL progression in a primary xenograft model. Finally, we were able to show that CXCR4 inhibition significantly decreased expression of Myc and its target genes. Myc expression is a key regulator of T-ALL leukemia initiating cell (LIC) activity, suggesting that CXCR4 inhibition can suppress LIC activity by silencing the Myc response in T-ALL cells. Our data suggest that targeting of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling could be a powerful new tool for combating T-ALL, a disease with no current targeted therapies.	gene	T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells	GSM1477305,GSM1477306,GSM1477307	GSM1477302,GSM1477303,GSM1477304	2017-01-04 01:50:17			drug	GPL17021	GSE60367	Mus musculus		AMD3100	
491	CD	Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial malignancy in childhood and accounts for approximately 15% of childhood cancer deaths. Amplification of N-Myc in neuroblastoma is associated with aggressive disease and predicts for poor prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches are therefore essential to improving patient outcomes in this setting. The histone deacetylases are known to interact with N-Myc and regulate numerous cellular processes, including differentiation in neuroblastoma. We therefore investigated the antitumor activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat in the setting of N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma using the TH-MYCN murine model. Continuous treatment of tumor bearing TH-MYCN transgenic mice with panobinostat for 9 weeks led to a significant improvement in survival as compared to mice treated with vehicle, or continuous treatment with panobinostat for a three week period. Panobinostat induced rapid tumor regression with no regrowth observed during the treatment period. Tumor response was associated with an initial apoptosis phenotype mediated via up-regulation of BMF and BIM. When treated was stopped at three weeks 100% of mice relapsed with aggressive neuroblastoma. Differentiation of neuroblastoma into benign ganglioneuroma, with a characteristic increase in S100 expression and reduction of N-Myc expression, was observed in mice treated for nine weeks, resulting in a sustained remission on 90% of mice treated. RNA-sequencing analysis of tumors from treated animals confirmed significant up-regulation of gene pathways associated with apoptosis and differentiation as early as 24 hours after treatment. Together our data demonstrate the potential of panobinostat as a therapeutic strategy for high-risk neuroblastoma patients.	gene	Neuroblastoma	GSM1711521,GSM1711522,GSM1711523,GSM1711524	GSM1711525,GSM1711526,GSM1711527,GSM1711528	2017-01-04 01:50:25			drug	GPL17021	GSE69869	Mus musculus		Panobinostat	
492	CD	Remembrances of traumata range among the most enduring forms of memories. Despite the elevated lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, effective strategies to attenuate long-term traumatic memories are scarce. The most efficacious treatments to diminish recent (i.e., day-old) traumata capitalize on memory updating mechanisms during reconsolidation that are initiated upon memory recall. Here, we show that in mice successful reconsolidation-updating paradigms for recent memories fail to attenuate remote (i.e., month-old) ones. We find that whereas recent memory recall induces a limited period of hippocampal neuroplasticity mediated, in part, by S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and histone acetylation, such plasticity is absent for remote memories. However, by using an HDAC2-targeting inhibitor (HDACi) during reconsolidation, even remote memories can be persistently attenuated. This intervention epigenetically primes the expression of neuroplasticity-related genes as revealed by whole genome RNA sequencing, which is accompanied by higher metabolic, synaptic and structural plasticity. Thus, applying HDACis during memory reconsolidation might constitute a treatment option for remote traumata.	gene	Hippocampus	GSM1300905,GSM1300906,GSM1300907	GSM1300908,GSM1300909,GSM1300910	2017-01-04 01:50:30			drug	GPL13112	GSE53794	Mus musculus		CI-994	
493	CD	Antioxidants are widely used to protect cells from damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement industry, and supported by some scientific studies. However, clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. Here, we show that supplementing the diet with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin E markedly increases tumor progression and reduces survival in mouse models of B-RAF- and K-RAS-induced lung cancer. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and vitamin E, which are structurally unrelated, produce highly coordinated changes in tumor transcriptome profiles, dominated by reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant genes. NAC and vitamin E increase tumor cell proliferation by reducing ROS, DNA damage, and p53 expression in mouse and human lung tumor cells. Inactivation of p53 increases tumor growth to a similar degree as antioxidants and abolishes the antioxidant effect. Thus, antioxidants accelerate tumor growth by inactivating the ROS-p53 axis. Because p53 inactivation occurs late in tumor progression, antioxidants may accelerate the growth of early tumors or precancerous lesions in high-risk populations such as smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who receive NAC to relieve mucus production.	gene	K-RAS-induced lung tumor	GSM1272294,GSM1272295,GSM1272296,GSM1272297,GSM1272298,GSM1272299,GSM1272300,GSM1272301,GSM1272302,GSM1272303	GSM1272304,GSM1272305,GSM1272306,GSM1272307,GSM1272308,GSM1272309,GSM1272310,GSM1272311,GSM1272312,GSM1272313	2017-01-04 01:50:41			drug	GPL13112	GSE52594	Mus musculus		N-acetylcysteine

This causes rapid transcriptional repression of Notch1 and associated targets including Myc, even in leukemias harboring spontaneous activating Notch1 mutations (producing aberrant ICN1) similar to those found in 60% of human T-ALL. Ikaros restoration results in sustained regression of Notch1-wild type leukemias while endogenous or engineered ICN1 expression promotes rapid disease relapse, indicating that ICN1 functionally antagonizes Ikaros in T-ALL.	gene	T-ALL cells	GSM1315568,GSM1315569,GSM1315570,GSM1315574,GSM1315575,GSM1315576	GSM1315571,GSM1315572,GSM1315573,GSM1315577,GSM1315578,GSM1315579	2017-01-04 01:50:59			drug	GPL13112	GSE54447	Mus musculus		Doxycycline

499	CD	Cancer cells must evade immune responses at distant sites to establish metastases. The lung is a frequent site for metastasis. We hypothesized that lung-specific immunoregulatory mechanisms create an immunologically permissive environment for tumor colonization. We found that T cell-intrinsic expression of the oxygen-sensing prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) proteins is required to maintain local tolerance against innocuous antigens in the lung, but powerfully licenses colonization by circulating tumor cells. PHD proteins limit pulmonary type helper (Th)-1 responses, promote CD4+-regulatory T (Treg) cell induction, and restrain CD8+ T cell effector function. Tumor colonization is accompanied by PHD protein-dependent induction of pulmonary Treg cells and suppression of IFN-g-dependent tumor clearance. T cell-intrinsic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PHD proteins limits tumor colonization of the lung and improves the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy. Collectively, PHD proteins function in T cells to coordinate distinct immunoregulatory programs within the lung that are permissive to cancer metastasis.	gene	Splenic CD4+ T cells	GSM2258157,GSM2258159,GSM2258161	GSM2258158,GSM2258160,GSM2258162	2017-01-04 01:51:14			drug	GPL13112; GPL17021	GSE85131	Mus musculus		DMOG	
500	CD	Terminal differentiation of multipotent stem cells is achieved through a coordinated cascade of activated transcription factors and epigenetic modifications that drive gene transcription responsible for unique cell fate. Within the mesenchymal lineage, factors such as RUNX2 and PPARγ are indispensable for osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We therefore investigated genomic binding of transcription factors and accompanying epigenetic modifications that occur during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). As assessed by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses, we found that genes vital for osteogenic identity were linked to RUNX2, C/EBPβ, RXR, and VDR binding sites, whereas adipocyte differentiation favored PPARγ, RXR, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ binding sites. Epigenetic marks were clear predictors of active differentiation loci as well as enhancer activities and selective gene expression. These marrow-derived MSCs displayed an epigenetic pattern that suggested a default preference for the osteogenic pathway; however, these patterns were rapidly altered near the Adipoq, Cidec, Fabp4, Lipe, Plin1, Pparg and Cebpa genes during adipogenic differentiation. Surprisingly, we found that these cells also exhibited an epigenetic plasticity that enabled them to trans-differentiate from adipocytes to osteoblasts (and vice-versa) after commitment, as assessed by staining, gene expression, and ChIP-qPCR analysis. The osteogenic default pathway may be subverted during pathological conditions leading to skeletal fragility and increased marrow adipocity during aging, estrogen deficiency and skeletal unloading. Taken together, our data provide an increased mechanistic understanding of the epigenetic programs necessary for multipotent differentiation of MSCs that may prove beneficial in the development of therapeutic strategies.	gene	Marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells - osteogenic media	GSM2104258,GSM2104259,GSM2104260	GSM2104261,GSM2104262,GSM2104263	2017-01-04 01:51:19			drug	GPL13112	GSE79814	Mus musculus		1,25(OH)2D3

Cochleas from postnatal day 0 and postnatal day 5 were cultured for 24 hours in the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT or DMSO as a vehicle control. Supporting cells were purified by FACS sorting for GFP fluorescence from the cochleas of transgenic mice in which a BAC including the LFng locus drives the expression of GFP. Two replicates of GFP+ supporting cells were compared with all other cochlear cell types that were GFP-.

509	CD	We previously found that mice deficient in the CD susceptibility gene Nod2 develop small intestinal abnormalities including impaired mucus production by goblet cells and susceptibility to injury, which were associated with interferon-gamma producing intraepithelial lymphocytes. These abnormalities were caused by a striking expansion of a common member of the microbiota, Bacteroides vulgatus. Remarkably, infection of Nod2-deficient mice with the helminth Trichuris muris led to a TH2 response that eliminated B. vulgatus colonization and intestinal abnormalities. In addition, treatment with recombinant IL13 (rIL13) or recombinant IL4 reduced B. vulgatus levels and eliminated goblet cell defects, suggesting that type 2 cytokines alone can reverse intestinal abnormalities in the absence of helminth infection. To determine the mechanism by which type 2 cytokines protected Nod2-/- mice from intestinal abnormalities, we performed RNA-seq on small intestinal tissue from WT, Nod2-/- and rIL13 treated Nod2-/- mice. We found that rIL13 treatment induced a wound healing response characterized by M2 macrophage activation genes. Hence, type 2 cytokines can reverse inflammatory imbalances in the composition of the gut microbiota that occurs in a genetically susceptible host.	gene	Small intestine (Nod2 knockout)	GSM2027195,GSM2027196,GSM2027197,GSM2027198	GSM2027199,GSM2027200,GSM2027201,GSM2027202,GSM2027203	2017-01-04 01:51:58			drug	GPL13112	GSE76504	Mus musculus		IL-13

527	CD	Through the analysis of mouse liver tumours promoted by distinct routes (DEN exposure alone DEN exposure plus non-genotoxic insult with phenobarbital and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease); we report that the cancer associated hyper-methylated CGI events in mice are also predicated by silent promoters that are enriched for both the DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and the histone modification H3K27me3 in normal liver. During cancer progression these CGIs undergo hypo-hydroxymethylation prior to subsequent hyper-methylation; whilst retaining H3K27me3. A similar loss of promoter-core 5hmC is observed in Tet1 deficient mouse livers indicating that reduced Tet1 binding at CGIs may be responsible for the epigenetic dysregulation observed during hepatocarcinogenesis. Consistent with this reduced Tet1 protein levels are observed in mouse liver tumour lesions. As in human DNA methylation changes at CGIs do not appear to be direct drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma progression in mice. Instead dynamic changes in H3K27me3 promoter deposition are strongly associated with tumour-specific activation and repression of transcription. Our data suggests that loss of promoter associated 5hmC in diverse liver tumours licences DNA methylation reprogramming at silent CGIs during cancer progression.	gene	Liver	GSM2057961,GSM2057962	GSM2057965,GSM2057966,GSM2057967	2017-01-04 01:59:23			disease	GPL17021	GSE77729	Mus musculus	Tumour		
528	CD	Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes an acute respiratory disease characterized by a strong inflammatory immune response and severe immunopathology. Pro-inflammatory mechanisms are well described in the murine IAV infection model, but less is known about the mechanisms leading to the resolution of inflammation. Here, we analyzed the contribution of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mono-MDSC) to this process. An accumulation of mono-MDSC within the lungs was observed during the course of IAV infection and phenotypic characterization of these mono-MDSC by flow cytometry and RNA-Seq revealed an activated phenotype showing both pro- and anti-inflammatory features, including the expression of iNOS by a fraction of cells in an IFN-g-dependent manner. Mono-MDSC isolated from lungs of IAV-infected animals displayed suppressive activity when tested in vitro, and iNOS inhibitors could abrogate this suppressive activity. Collectively, our data suggest that during IAV infection monocytes can differentiate into mono-MDSC, which might contribute to the prevention of immunopathology during this life-threatening disease.	gene	Spleen (Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells)	GSM1533486,GSM1533487,GSM1533488	GSM1533483,GSM1533484,GSM1533485	2017-01-04 01:59:28			disease	GPL17021	GSE62795	Mus musculus	Acute respiratory disease (Inf		
529	CD	Aging and increased amyloid burden are major risk factors for cognitive diseases such as Alzheimers Disease (AD). An effective therapy does not yet exist. Here we use mouse models for age-associated memory impairment and amyloid deposition to study transcriptome and cell type-specific epigenome plasticity at the systems level in the brain and in peripheral organs. We show that at the level of epigenetic gene-expression aging and amyloid pathology are associated with inflammation and impaired synaptic function in the hippocampal CA1 region. While inflammation is associated with increased gene-expression that is linked to a subset of transcription factors de-regulation of plasticity genes is mediated via different mechanisms in the amyloid and the aging model. Amyloid pathology impairs histone-acetylation and decreases expression of plasticity genes while aging affects differential splicing that is linked to altered H4K12 acetylation at the intron-exon junction in neurons but not in non-neuronal cells. We furthermore show that oral administration of the clinically approved histone deacetylase inhibitor Vorinostat not only restores spatial memory but also exhibits an anti-inflammatory action and reinstates epigenetic balance and transcriptional homeostasis at the level of gene expression and exon usage. This is the first systems-level investigation of transcriptome plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region in aging and AD models and of the effects of an orally dosed histone deacetylase inhibitor. Our data has important implications for the development of minimally invasive and cost-effective therapeutic strategies against age-associated cognitive decline. In fact our data strongly suggest to test Vorinostat in patients suffering from AD.)	gene	Hippocampus (CA1 subregion)	GSM1560991,GSM1560992,GSM1560993,GSM1560994,GSM1560995,GSM1560996	GSM1561005,GSM1561006,GSM1561007,GSM1561008,GSM1561009,GSM1561010	2017-01-04 01:59:37			disease	GPL13112	GSE63943	Mus musculus	Alzheimer's Disease (mouse mod	SAHA

531	CD	Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an early onset autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by loss of or mutation in SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1). Despite understanding the genetic basis underlying this disease it is still not known why motor neurons (MNs) are selectively affected by the loss of the ubiquitously expressed SMN protein. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) model for severe SMA the RNA transcript profiles (transcriptomes) between control and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn-/-) mESC-derived MNs were compared in this study using massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The MN differentiation efficiencies between control and severe SMA mESCs were similar. RNA-Seq analysis identified 3094 upregulated and 6964 downregulated transcripts in SMA mESC-derived MNs when compared against control cells. Pathway and network analysis of the differentially expressed RNA transcripts showed that pluripotency and cell proliferation transcripts were significantly increased in SMA MNs while transcripts related to neuronal development and activity were reduced. The differential expression of selected transcripts such as Crabp1 Crabp2 and Nkx2.2 was validated in a second mESC model for SMA as well as in the spinal cords of low copy SMN2 severe SMA mice. Furthermore the levels of these selected transcripts were restored in high copy SMN2 rescue mouse spinal cords when compared against low copy SMN2 severe SMA mice. These findings suggest that SMN deficiency affects processes critical for normal development and maintenance of MNs.	gene	Motor neurons	GSM1358335,GSM1358336,GSM1358337	GSM1358338,GSM1358339,GSM1358340	2017-01-04 01:59:45			disease	GPL17021	GSE56284	Mus musculus	Spinal muscular atrophy		
532	CD	Recently attenuated Semliki Forest virus vector VA7 completely eliminated type I interferon (IFN) unresponsive human U87 glioma xenografts while IFN responsive mouse GL261 and CT-2A gliomas proved refractory to the oncolytic virotherapy. Here we describe in two clones of a well established Balb/c mouse tumor cell line CT26 murine colon carcinoma diametrically opposed IFN responsiveness and sensitivity to oncolytic virus. Both CT26WT and CT26LacZ clones secreted biologically active type I IFN in vitro upon infection but virus replication was self-limiting only in CT26WT cells. Total transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and western blotting experiments revealed that in sharp contrast to CT26LacZ cells CT26WT cells had strong constitutive expression of 56 different genes associated with pattern recognition and type I interferon signaling pathways spanning two reported anti-RNA virus gene signatures and22 genes that have been reported to have direct anti-Alphaviral activity.

533	CD	Recently attenuated Semliki Forest virus vector VA7 completely eliminated type I interferon (IFN) unresponsive human U87 glioma xenografts while IFN responsive mouse GL261 and CT-2A gliomas proved refractory to the oncolytic virotherapy. Here we describe in two clones of a well established Balb/c mouse tumor cell line CT26 murine colon carcinoma diametrically opposed IFN responsiveness and sensitivity to oncolytic virus. Both CT26WT and CT26LacZ clones secreted biologically active type I IFN in vitro upon infection but virus replication was self-limiting only in CT26WT cells. Total transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and western blotting experiments revealed that in sharp contrast to CT26LacZ cells CT26WT cells had strong constitutive expression of 56 different genes associated with pattern recognition and type I interferon signaling pathways spanning two reported anti-RNA virus gene signatures and22 genes that have been reported to have direct anti-Alphaviral activity.

534	CD	The preferential localization of some neoplasms such as serrated polyps in specific areas of the intestine suggests that non-genetic factors may be important for their development. To test this hypothesis we took advantage of transgenic mice that expressed HB-EGF throughout the intestine but develop serrated polyps only in the cecum. Here we show that a host-specific microbiome was associated with serrated polyps and that alterations of the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment or by embryo-transfer rederivation markedly inhibited the formation of serrated polyps in the cecum. Mechanistically development of serrated polyps was associated with a local decrease in epithelial barrier-function bacterial invasion production of antimicrobials and increased expression of several inflammatory factors such as IL-17 Cxcl2 Tnf-\\\\xeb\\\\xb1 and IL-1. Increased number of neutrophils were found within the serrated polyps and their depletion significantly reduced polyp growth. Together these results indicate that non-genetic factors contribute to the development of serrated polyps and suggest that the development of these intestinal neoplasms in the cecum is driven by the interplay between genetic changes in the host an inflammatory response and a host-specific microbiota.	gene	Cecum	GSM1155642,GSM1155644,GSM1155646	GSM1155643,GSM1155645,GSM1155647	2017-01-04 01:59:56			disease	GPL13112	GSE47735	Mus musculus	SERRATED POLYP

541	CD	We compared mRNA profiles of isolated glomeruli versus sorted podocytes between diabetic and control mice. IRG mice crossed with eNOS-/- mice were further bred with podocin-rTTA and TetON-Cre mice to permanently label podocytes before the diabetic injury. Diabetes was induced by injection of streptozotocin. mRNA profiles of isolated glomeruli and sorted podocytes from diabetic and control mice at 10 weeks after induction of diabetes were examined. Consistent with the previous reports, expression of podocyte-specific markers in the glomeruli were down-regulated in the diabetic mice compared to controls. However, these differences disappeared when mRNA levels were corrected for podocyte number per glomerulus. Interestingly, the expression of these markers was not altered in sorted podocytes from diabetic mice, suggesting that the reduced expression of podocyte markers in isolated glomeruli is likely a secondary effect of reduced podocyte number, rather than the loss of differentiation markers. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes in diabetic mice also revealed distinct up-regulated pathways in the glomeruli (mitochondrial function and oxidative stress) and podocytes (actin organization). In conclusion, our data suggest that podocyte-specific gene expression in transcriptome obtained from the whole glomeruli may not represent those of podocytes in the diabetic kidney.	gene	Glomeruli	GSM2090948,GSM2090949,GSM2090950,GSM2090951	GSM2090944,GSM2090945,GSM2090946,GSM2090947	2017-01-04 02:00:25			disease	GPL17021	GSE79291	Mus musculus	STZ-Induced Diabetes		
542	CD	To characterize gene expression changes in AML induced by CNTRL-FGFR1, we used RNA-seq analysis of sorted Mac+Gr1+B220+ AML cells (n = 2) from the SP and BM of leukemic mice, as well as sorted Mac+Gr1+ myeloid cells (n=3) from normal mice. Methods: cDNA libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the resulting cDNA libraries were assessed using a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent) and quantified by quantitative PCR (Bio-Rad). The cDNA libraries were sequenced using paired end Illumina Hiseq2000 protocols (50 cycles). The Illumina sequencing pipeline version 1.8 was employed for transferring raw images to base calls, generating sequence reads, and de-multiplexing the reads. The generated FASTQ files were imported to CLC Genomics Workbench and aligned to the mouse genome, NCBI37/mm9. The transcript expression levels were determined in terms of number of reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) and compared between sorted normal myeloid (Gr1+Mac1+) cells and sorted leukemic myeloid cells. Results: The result showed a remarkable difference between normal (Gr1+Mac1+) and leukemic (Mac+Gr1+B220+) myeloid cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and leading-edge analysis suggested that Mac+Gr1+B220+ cells have the potential to differentiate into either myeloid or T-cell, but not a B-cell, lineages. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of lineage-specific genes showed increased expression of Flt3, Gfi1, and Kit related to early myeloid-lineage commitment, while genes related to myeloid differentiation, Irf8, Klf4, Csf1r, Myc, and Spi1 were decreased compared with normal myeloid cells. Quantitative RT-PCR also confirmed that the Cd3e and Lmo2 T-cell specific genes were markedly increased in AML cells. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the CNTRL-FGFR1 fusion kinase induces bi-lineage myeloid and T-lymphoid disease in model mice. Genetic and molecular analyses in these models demonstrated that multiple signaling pathways, specifically related to myeloid and T-lymphoid lineages, were altered in neoplasms, which underscores the importance of developing therapies that target all of these signaling pathways to eradicate the leukemia-initiating-cells	gene	Bone marrow cells	GSM1166354,GSM1166355,GSM1166356	GSM1166357,GSM1166358	2017-01-04 02:00:28			disease	GPL13112	GSE48048	Mus musculus	Leukemia

555	CD	Using a CML mouse model, we identified differences in gene expression between leukemic compared with non-leukemic LTHSC, including increased expression of the thrombopoietin (THPO) receptor MPL. LTHSC expressing high levels of MPL showed enhanced JAK/STAT signaling and proliferation in response to THPO in vitro, and increased leukemogenic capacity in vivo compared to LTHSC with low MPL expression. Although both G0 and S-phase subpopulations were increased in MPL expressing LTHSC, LSC capacity was restricted to quiescent cells. Inhibition of MPL expression in CML LTHSC resulted in reduced THPO-induced JAK/STAT signaling and leukemogenic potential. Similar observations were made with LTHSC from CML patients. MPL expressing LTHSC demonstrated reduced sensitivity to BCR-ABL TKI treatment but demonstrated increased sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Our studies identify MPL expression levels as a key determinant of heterogeneous leukemia-initiating capacity and drug sensitivity of CML LTHSC, and suggest that MPL-expressing CML stem cells are critical targets for therapy.	gene	LTHSCs	GSM1974562,GSM1974563,GSM1974564	GSM1974557,GSM1974558,GSM1974559,GSM1974560,GSM1974561	2017-01-04 02:01:24		GSM1974565	disease	GPL17021	GSE76123	Mus musculus	Leukemia
